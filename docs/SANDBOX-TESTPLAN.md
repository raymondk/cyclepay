# Stripe sandbox test plan (manual, human-in-the-browser)

Most Stripe payloads in the automated suites are hand-crafted JSON written from the
API docs, so those suites prove the canister behaves as designed against *our* idea
of Stripe rather than against Stripe. This plan closes that gap and captures real
fixtures while doing it.

**Read §"What this cannot tell you" at the end before treating a green run as
go-live approval.** It is not one.

## Status: run against reserve delivery on 2026-08-28

⚠️ **Read the dates before trusting any row.** A row here is a record of what a run on a
given day did and did not observe, and the mechanism under it may have changed since. A
row that was true when written and is now false reads exactly like a current gap, and the
cost of that confusion is re-running a whole plan that was in fact verified. The dates in
the heading are what make each row checkable.

**What the 2026-08-28 run recorded**, all of it against `icrc1_transfer` out of the
reserve, with no ICP or CMC in the path:

| Flow | Result |
|---|---|
| $20 → paid | delivered |
| $13, custom amount → paid | delivered |
| $10 → cancelled by the buyer | released; the **open-order cap of 1** refused a second order while one was open |
| $10 → left to expire | expired **by Stripe** (`stripe.sessionExpired`), promise released **exactly**: `promisedTotal` 7,238,461,538,461 → 0 |
| full refund of a delivered order | `#refundAfterDelivery`, `refundedCents = 1300`, `fullRefund = true`, correctly **not** auto-resolved |

Stripe fired `checkout.session.expired` within ~2 s of `expires_at`, and the session
TTL is **35 minutes** (`Session.requestedLifetimeSeconds = 2_100`), not 30 — Stripe's
floor is evaluated against *its* clock on arrival, so sitting exactly on it fails every
session creation.

**What the 2026-08-13 run recorded** (kept only for the Stripe-side figures; its
delivery half was a CMC mint against an ICP float and is no longer evidence): two
purchases, $5 and $20, both credited to the buyer's cycles-ledger account and spendable
— `icp cycles balance --of-principal <buyer>` → **18,207,492,307,692**.

**What is owed before go-live:**

| Gap | Where |
|---|---|
| ⚠️ **The buyer's cycles-ledger balance, read from the LEDGER, on a reserve delivery.** The 08-28 run confirmed the order view said `delivered` and an audit line recorded a block index — which is *the canister's own account* of the transfer, not an independent observation of the destination. The 08-13 run did read the balance directly, but under the mint path. **One command, not a re-run:** `icp cycles balance --of-principal <buyer>` before and after | group H below |
| The CLI handoff — `icp identity link web` was never run, so "the cycles are reachable from the CLI" is still unproven. ⚠️ Doubly unproven since the page gained the id.ai prerequisite and the set-default step: without either, the commands run as the wrong identity against an empty balance | group H below, H4 |
| Fixture capture — real payloads committed; the parity test in `test/integration/src/fixtures.spec.ts` compares them against the crafted builder | group I |
| Async payment methods | ⚠️ **Not applicable** — `payment_method_types[]=card` is pinned, so a delayed method is unreachable |
| Disputes | group G |
| Anything live-mode | not local-testable by construction |

---

## Two places to run it, and both do the whole good path

**Either works end to end. Neither needs mainnet or real money.**

| | PocketIC suite | local `icp network` |
|---|---|---|
| Cycles ledger + CMC (rate only) | ✅ real wasms | ✅ seeded |
| XRC | ✅ pinned `xrc_mock` | ✅ the `xrc` canister in `icp.yaml` |
| Fresh CMC rate | ✅ built in | ✅ via the PocketIC API (below) |
| Real Stripe events | ✅ `makeLive()` + `stripe listen` | ✅ `stripe listen` at the gateway |
| Time travel / outage injection | ✅ first-class | ✅ via the PocketIC API |
| **Frontend in a browser** | ❌ no `ic_env` cookie | ✅ **only here** |
| Repeatable, scripted, in CI | ✅ | ❌ manual |

Pick the **PocketIC suite** for anything you want to keep (it is committed, scripted
and runs in CI). Pick a **local network** when you need the real UI in a browser,
which is the one thing PocketIC cannot serve.

⚠️ Earlier versions of this file claimed a local network could not do this — twice,
both wrong. What makes it work: `icp network start` runs **PocketIC**, and its
control API is reachable. `lsof` on the launcher shows two listening ports — the HTTP
gateway that `icp network status` reports, and the PocketIC API alongside it. So a
local network has the two powers that look like they should be missing: **arbitrary
sender impersonation** and **time control**.

⚠️ **That is not a supported `icp` interface.** It depends on the launcher being
PocketIC and on that port being open, and either could change between releases. The
committed suites deliberately do not rely on it — it is a manual-testing convenience.

### The whole flow, in order, in a browser

This is **the** procedure. Everything below it in this file is either a group of
scenarios to work through or a by-hand reference for one of these steps.

What you have to supply: a **Stripe sandbox account** with the Stripe CLI logged in
to it, and a **restricted API key** (`rk_...`) with **Checkout Sessions = Write**
and everything else None. Write is the level that also grants read, which the recovery
sweep needs in order to retrieve a session — **measured, not inferred: a `rk_`
key scoped to Checkout Sessions = Write returns HTTP 200 on
`GET /v1/checkout/sessions/{id}`.** It is worth stating as a measurement because the
failure mode is invisible to the test suite: PocketIC answers the sweep's outcall
itself, so a key that could create sessions but not read them would 401 in production
with every scenario green. `Main.mo` carries a `stripe.retrieveUnauthorized` audit tag
for that case. No Payment Links, no Products, no Prices — the canister creates a
session per order through the API. Nothing else, and no mainnet.

**How to create the key, and the go-live ordering, is RUNBOOK §3.**
Get it right here rather than at go-live: the four settings that break
`amount_total == tier.usdCents` produce no error, just a different cycle quantity,
so a sandbox run with automatic tax left on would "pass" while proving the wrong
thing.

```sh
# 0. Prerequisites, once.
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe jq
stripe login                                    # a SANDBOX account, never live
npm --prefix test/integration run fetch:wasm    # the sha256-pinned xrc mock
npm --prefix test/browser ci                    # only if you also want the suites

# 1. A sellable local gateway. Put STRIPE_API_KEY=rk_... in scripts/.local-dev.env
#    (gitignored, sourced by the seed) so you set it once rather than per shell,
#    and so it never lands in your shell history. Without it the seed sets a
#    placeholder: everything except paying works, and create_order fails with a
#    real Stripe 401 rather than at a config check.
#
#    ⚠️ Keep it in that file rather than `export`ing it. The durable reason: the seed
#    sources the file into its own process, so the key never reaches your shell history,
#    `ps` or a terminal transcript.
#    ⚠️ The CLI hazard, stated precisely — this used to overclaim it. The Stripe CLI
#    prefers STRIPE_API_KEY over its own `stripe login`, and a restricted key cannot open
#    a CLI session, so a `stripe` command that sees it fails 403
#    "more_permissions_required". **This repo's own scripts are immune** — every `stripe`
#    invocation is wrapped `env -u STRIPE_API_KEY` (stripe-dev.sh, capture-stripe-fixtures.sh),
#    so the forwarder is unaffected. What is exposed is a `stripe` command you type
#    yourself; `capture-stripe-fixtures.sh` prints one for you to run.
#    Nothing to configure in the Dashboard: the session carries inline price_data
#    with a fixed unit_amount and quantity 1, and none of the settings that could
#    move amount_total is enabled — src/backend/rails/Session.mo lists all eight
#    next to the body builder, and test/session.test.mo asserts their absence.
#    Nothing else to configure: the STRIPE_LINK_* variables went with
#    Tier.paymentLinkUrl.
icp network start -d
icp deploy
scripts/local-dev-seed.sh

# 2. Wire Stripe, in its own terminal. It asserts the gateway can price before it
#    starts, and leaves the forwarder running until Ctrl-C.
scripts/stripe-dev.sh
```

⚠️ **The CMC rate has a 15-minute fuse, and it is the single most likely thing to
derail this run.** The seed arms a rate; 15 minutes later the gateway cannot price,
`create_order` is refused, and the symptom is *not* a rate error — `scripts/stripe-dev.sh`
fails its preflight with **"the gateway cannot price a $10 purchase"**, which reads like a
configuration problem. That is exactly how this procedure failed when it was last walked.

The fix takes two seconds and needs no reinstall:

```sh
scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only
```

So: **re-arm immediately before you pay**, not when you started. Any pause — reading this
file, registering a passkey, a phone call between creating the order and opening Checkout —
can outlast the rate. Two things soften it, and knowing which is which saves confusion:

- An order that **already exists** keeps its locked quantity forever; a stale rate only
  refuses *new* orders. So if you got the order created, paying still works.
- A run that sits in the browser for half an hour will fail at **create**, not at pay.

⚠️ And the reason it cannot simply be longer: `Pricing.mo` refuses a CMC rate older than
15 minutes **by design** — a stale rate misprices an order, and the local CMC's rate is
stamped 2021 until something sets it. The fuse is the guard working, not a rough edge.

Then, in the browser at the frontend URL `icp deploy` printed
(`http://frontend.local.localhost:8000/` with the default gateway port):

1. **Click "Get cycles".** The landing page has one route into the buy form, and
   the form asks nothing about where the cycles go: they go to the account of the
   principal you sign in as, and the gateway refuses any other destination.
   That is what makes steps 6 and 7 meaningful.
2. **Sign in.** You get **local** Internet Identity automatically —
   `http://id.ai.localhost:8000`, deployed by `ii: true` in `icp.yaml`, chosen by
   `auth.ts` because the origin ends in `.localhost`. Nothing to configure, and a
   production origin cannot take that branch. Register a passkey; it is throwaway
   and local to this network, which is wiped by `icp network stop`.
3. **Pick an amount and create the order.** The rate is locked here, not at payment.
4. **Pay.** "Pay with card ↗" opens the order's own Checkout Session — the
   canister created it and set `client_reference_id` on it through the API,
   so there is no link to configure and no parameter to append. Card
   `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC. **You have 35 minutes**,
   enforced by Stripe; the button disappears at the deadline.
5. **Watch the page.** Leave the order tab open. The webhook arrives at the
   forwarder, delivery runs, and the page reaches **delivered** on its own 3 s poll
   with the guided tour leading. It should never need a reload.

   **If nothing happens**, work these three in order — each has produced a silent
   stall in a real run:

   | Check | Command | Wrong looks like |
   |---|---|---|
   | the secret is provisioned | `icp canister call backend webhook_secret_status '()'` | `isSet = false` — every event is dropped unverified, with no audit line and no error-queue entry |
   | the forwarder is up | `pgrep -fl "stripe listen"` | nothing — Stripe delivered to a closed door, and a resend is delivered **once**, so resending before the forwarder is up wastes it |
   | the CMC rate is fresh | `icp canister call backend audit_log_recent '(null, 25 : nat)' \| grep rates.refresh` | `rates.refreshFailed: cmc rate is stale or zero` — re-arm with `./scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only`. ⚠️ A stale rate fails at **order creation**, not at delivery: delivery reads no rate at all, so an order already `#paid` delivers regardless |

   To replay a payment the canister missed, resend the **`checkout.session.completed`**
   event — not `charge.updated`, `charge.succeeded` or `payment_intent.succeeded`,
   which Stripe lists just as prominently and none of which this canister acts on
   (see `Card.mo` for the four types it handles). A resent event of the wrong type
   logs `stripe.unhandledType` and changes nothing:

   ```sh
   stripe events list --limit 25          # find the checkout.session.completed
   stripe events resend <evt_...>
   ```

   `audit_log` is the diagnostic that separates these: a verified-but-unactionable
   event, a bad signature and an event that never arrived all look identical from
   the UI, and all three read differently there.
6. **Follow the CLI page** at `#/cli` — from the delivered order's next-step link, or
   from the dashboard. It is five numbered steps and the order is load-bearing:

   ```sh
   # Step 1 is a SETTING, not a command: turn CLI access on at https://id.ai →
   # settings. Without it the next command's sign-in page says "CLI access not
   # enabled" and never returns an identity.
   icp identity link web cyclepay-id --app <host>   # 2 — bare domain, port included
   icp identity default cyclepay-id                 # 3 — what makes the rest act as it
   icp identity principal                           # 4 — must equal the page's principal
   icp cycles balance                               # 4 — must equal the page's figure
   icp deploy -e ic                                 # 5 — the buyer's own project
   ```

   **The principal must match.** A mismatch means the `--app` value did not match this
   origin, and the balance will look empty. ⚠️ **No `--identity` flag on the two verify
   commands, deliberately** — step 3 made it the default, and passing the flag would
   verify an identity that `icp deploy` will not use.
7. **Prove the cycles exist.**

   ```sh
   icp cycles balance --of-principal <the principal from step 6>  # from any identity
   ```

   This is the end of the flow the product promises, and the one thing no suite in
   this repo proves.

⚠️ **The CMC rate expires 15 minutes after seeding** and new orders are then refused
(an existing order is unaffected — its rate is locked). Refresh with
`scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only`; it needs no restart and nothing else to be
re-done.

### The same setup by hand, if you want to see each lever

```sh
icp network start -d
icp deploy
scripts/local-dev-seed.sh
```

`icp deploy` leaves a gateway that is **fail-closed on several axes at once** — no
tiers, no CMC rate, no Stripe secrets and an empty cycles reserve — plus one that
catches everyone: `minCanisterCycles` defaults to 5 T while `icp deploy` creates the
canister with less, so the admission gate refuses every purchase with "temporarily
unavailable while the gateway is topped up". That reads as a reserve problem and is
really about the canister's own **gas** — two different pots, and this is the error
that teaches the difference. The seed script tops the canister up
(`icp canister top-up backend --amount 20t`) and leaves the 5 T floor in place, so
local development exercises the same gate mainnet does.

The seed script sets all five and verifies a $5 purchase is admitted before it
reports success. **The CMC rate goes stale after 15 minutes** (`cmcRateMaxAgeNs` is
a security control, not a tuning knob); `scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only`
refreshes just that.

No restart is needed after seeding, and none of it survives a `--mode reinstall`.

### Every lever the seed script pulls, spelled out

Reference, not a second procedure: `scripts/local-dev-seed.sh` does all of this and
verifies the outcome of each step rather than the exit code. Read it when a step
fails and you need to know which lever to inspect, or when configuring something
that is not a local network.

```sh
npm --prefix test/integration run fetch:wasm    # the pinned xrc_mock
icp network start -d && icp deploy              # backend + xrc + frontend

# The admission gate checks the canister's OWN cycles before pricing, and a fresh
# deploy sits under the 5 T floor.
icp canister top-up backend --amount 20t

# Config. The webhook secret is SEALED (§7.3) — `set_webhook_secret` takes a ciphertext
# blob, so it cannot be set with a quoted string. No trailing environment argument here:
# the default is `local`, which is the PocketIC master key this network uses.
# The 16-byte minimum applies to the decrypted value.
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET='whsec_local_test_1234567890' scripts/seal-secret.sh webhook-secret
icp canister call backend set_card_tiers \
  '(vec { record { id = "t10"; usdCents = 1_000 : nat } })'
icp canister call backend set_delivery_config \
  '(record { alertAfterNs = 7_200_000_000_000 : int; maxHoldNs = 259_200_000_000_000 : int })'
icp canister call backend set_expected_livemode '(opt false)'

# Fund the reserve: the cycles the gateway will SELL, in its own cycles-ledger
# account. ⚠️ This is not the canister's gas — that is the top-up above. Nothing
# creates these cycles; you transfer cycles you already have, which is also the
# mainnet procedure.
BACKEND_ID=$(icp canister status backend --json | jq -r '.id')
icp cycles transfer 100t "$BACKEND_ID"
# Then let the gateway observe what arrived. Until it does, the admission gate has
# no reason to believe it can deliver and refuses with `#reserveShort`.
icp canister call backend refresh_reserve '()'
icp canister call backend reserve_status '()'   # availableToSell > 0

# Give the CMC a current rate (next section), then:
icp canister call backend refresh_rates '()'
icp canister call backend pricing_status '()' --query   # expect ok = true
```

Create an order and open the `stripeSessionUrl` on the returned order — that is
the payment page. The canister creates a **Checkout Session per order** and sets
`client_reference_id` through the API, so there is no Payment Link to
configure and no URL parameter to append. Pay with `4242 4242 4242 4242` and watch
`get_order` reach `delivered`. `process_order` kicks the **delivery** without
waiting for the sweep — callable as the order's own owner as well as admin since
and `pending_deliveries` (admin) shows anything still outstanding
before the 2 h queue alert would. `delivery_journal` and `receipt` then carry the real
cycles-ledger block index and the delivered quantity.

⚠️ **Fund the reserve AND call `refresh_reserve` before creating an order**, or
every purchase is refused with `#reserveShort{available = 0}` against a funded
account: solvency is decided against a lower bound that only rises by observation
`reserve_status.availableToSell` is the figure to check.

⚠️ **One thing that looks like a bug and is not:**

- **The session expires 35 minutes after creation**, enforced by Stripe. Past that
  the pay button disappears — the UI renders expiry from `expiresAtNs`, not from
  the status, so it goes even before the `checkout.session.expired` webhook lands.

The post-payment redirect **does** land now: the seed points the origin at
`http://frontend.local.localhost:<port>`, which `Session.validateOrigin` accepts because
the host is loopback. A caller-supplied `success_url` remains deliberately impossible —
it would be an open redirect Stripe renders after a real payment.

#### Giving the local CMC a current rate

**Why this is needed — and it is not "nobody updates the rate".** PocketIC has no
API for setting the conversion rate (`IcpFeaturesConfig` has exactly one variant,
`DefaultConfig`). It solves the problem a different way, documented on the
`cyclesMinting` feature:

> Deploys the NNS cycles minting canister, sets ICP/XDR conversion rate… **If
> enabled, the default timestamp of a PocketIC instance is set to 10 May 2021
> 10:00:01 AM CEST (the smallest value that is strictly larger than the default
> timestamp hard-coded in the CMC state).**

So the 2021 timestamp is not stale seeded data — **PocketIC deliberately pins the
instance clock to 2021 so the CMC's hard-coded rate is fresh.** That alignment is
why the committed integration suite works.

A local `icp network` breaks it by running at **real wall-clock time** (verified:
instance time reads as today while the CMC rate still reads 2021-05-10). Against the
15-minute staleness guard the rate is then permanently stale, and pricing reports
`"cmc rate is stale or zero"`.

Two ways to restore the alignment:

- **Move the rate forward** (below). Keeps real time, so real Stripe signatures
  verify. This is what you want.
- Move the *clock* back to 2021. Also works, and needs no impersonation — but then
  every real Stripe signature is rejected, because the canister checks the signature
  timestamp against its own clock with a ±300 s tolerance. It trades the CMC problem
  for the Stripe problem.

⚠️ **Impersonation itself is a first-class PocketIC feature, not a hack** — the
committed suite does exactly the same thing through `gw.cmcAsGovernance`, a
sender-scoped actor. The only unsupported part on a local network is *reaching* the
control API, because icp-cli does not publish its port.

⚠️ **The CMC requires a strictly greater timestamp** than the one it holds
("Proposed conversion rate must have greater timestamp"), so a second call inside the
same second fails. `setCmcRate` in the harness nudges time by 1 s first.

⚠️ **The PocketIC port is dynamic even with a fixed gateway port.** With
`gateway.port: 8000` the launcher listens on 8000 *and* an OS-picked port — the
latter is the control API. Discover it:

```sh
PID=$(pgrep -f 'pocket-ic --ttl' | head -1)
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -a -p "$PID" | awk 'NR>1{print $9}' | grep -v ':8000$'
```

```js
// run from test/integration/ so the imports resolve
import { Principal } from '@icp-sdk/core/principal';
import { IDL } from '@icp-sdk/core/candid';

// Find the PocketIC port — it is the OTHER port the launcher listens on:
//   lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -a -p "$(pgrep -f 'pocket-ic --ttl')"
const PIC = 'http://127.0.0.1:<pic-port>/instances/0';
const b64 = (u8) => Buffer.from(u8).toString('base64');
const Arg = IDL.Record({
  data_source: IDL.Text, timestamp_seconds: IDL.Nat64, xdr_permyriad_per_icp: IDL.Nat64,
});
const t = await fetch(`${PIC}/read/get_time`).then((r) => r.json());
const payload = new Uint8Array(IDL.encode([Arg], [{
  data_source: 'local-dev',
  timestamp_seconds: BigInt(Math.floor(Number(t.nanos_since_epoch) / 1e9)),
  xdr_permyriad_per_icp: 35_000n,
}]));
await fetch(`${PIC}/update/submit_ingress_message`, {
  method: 'POST', headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    sender: b64(Principal.fromText('rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai').toUint8Array()),
    canister_id: b64(Principal.fromText('rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai').toUint8Array()),
    method: 'set_icp_xdr_conversion_rate',
    payload: b64(payload),
    effective_principal: { None: null },
  }),
});
```

`/update/set_time`, `/update/set_certified_time` and `/update/tick` on the same
instance give time travel, so the 2 h alert and 72 h terminate are reachable locally
too.
### One command: `npm --prefix test/integration run sandbox`

Boots PocketIC with everything, aligns the clock, bootstraps dev config, goes live,
prints the webhook URL, and stays up until Ctrl-C.

```sh
stripe login                                  # a SANDBOX account, never live
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(stripe listen --print-secret)" \
STRIPE_API_KEY=rk_...                         \
  npm --prefix test/integration run sandbox
# then, second terminal:
stripe listen --forward-to '<the URL it prints>'
```

⚠️ **Both keys are prefixed onto one command, not exported — and that matters.** The
Stripe CLI prefers `STRIPE_API_KEY` from the environment over its own `stripe login`
credential, and the restricted key cannot open a CLI session (`stripecli_session_write`
is not among its permissions, correctly). Export it and the second command above fails
with *"more_permissions_required"* naming your `rk_` key. Prefixing scopes it to the
process that needs it.

⚠️ **`STRIPE_API_KEY` is what makes an order possible, not just a payment.** The rail
creates a Checkout Session per order, so `create_order` itself calls Stripe — without
a key the harness boots and says so, and everything except ordering works. Use a
**restricted** key (`rk_...`) with **Checkout Sessions = Write** (which includes the
read the sweep needs) and everything else None: a leaked key at that scope can only
create sessions that pay *us*, while an unrestricted `sk_` can issue refunds.

⚠️ **It lowers `minPurchaseUsdCents` to $1**, because its whole numeric vector is the
$5 at-cost case (500¢ − 45¢ fee = 455¢ = exactly one ICP at $4.55 = 3.5 T cycles) and
the gate's real floor is $10. That is a dev value like the 2-minute alert, not a
mainnet one.

Everything is fake money and real plumbing: a real cycles ledger, a real CMC rate, real
cycles delivery, genuine signed Stripe events over a genuine HTTP gateway.

### The setup, if you are writing your own spec

```ts
await pic.setTime(new Date());            // so real Stripe signatures verify (±300 s)
await pic.setCertifiedTime(new Date());
await setXrcRate(gw); await setCmcRate(gw);   // working price inputs
const port = await pic.makeLive();        // real HTTP gateway
```

Then point the Stripe CLI at it:

```sh
stripe login                              # SANDBOX account, never live
stripe listen --forward-to "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/webhook/stripe?canisterId=<backendId>"
```

`src/live-gateway.spec.ts` already does the canister half and logs the exact URL —
run it, copy the line, and drive real events at it. Call `pic.stopLive()` when you
need time control back for the delay/terminate scenarios.

⚠️ **Two gotchas.** `makeLive` enables auto-progress, which is incompatible with
`advanceTime` — hence the separate spec file, and `stopLive()` before any
time-travel. And the clock alignment is not optional: a PocketIC instance starts
years away from now, so without `setTime` every genuine Stripe signature is
rejected with a 400.

### What still needs somewhere else

| Need | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Completing a **hosted Checkout page** | a browser | Stripe deliberately has no headless path. `stripe trigger --override checkout_session:client_reference_id=<ref>` gets you a real *signed event* with the right reference, which covers attribution without the UI |
| **Frontend click-through** (group H) | ✅ a **local network** — see the walkthrough above | the asset canister serves the `ic_env` cookie the page needs; PocketIC does not |
| Live-mode behaviour: Radar, 3DS, payouts, disputes, account restrictions | mainnet + Stripe **live**, tight caps | unmockable |

Group H runs against a **local network**, not mainnet: the asset canister serves the
`ic_env` cookie the page reads for the backend id and root key.

Sign-in there uses **local** Internet Identity, and it does so automatically —
`identityProvider()` in `auth.ts` derives `http://id.ai.localhost:<port>/authorize`
from the page's own origin whenever the hostname ends in `.localhost`, and mainnet
`https://id.ai` otherwise. There is no environment variable to set and no way for a
production origin to take the local branch. (`VITE_II_URL` overrides both, and
exists for the PocketIC sandbox script.)

The frontend's *state logic* is covered headlessly by `main.test.ts` (jsdom) and its
*rendering* by `test/browser/` in Chromium, so what a human adds here is the real
login, the real Checkout page, the deployed-cookie path, and whether the CLI page's
commands land on the right principal.

**Nothing in this plan requires a mainnet deploy.** Only live-mode Stripe behaviour
does — Radar, 3DS, payouts, account restrictions — and that is a separate decision
from verifying the build.

Everything else — signatures, attribution, amounts, dedup, refunds, async methods,
event types, livemode, **and full delivery** — runs in PocketIC.

### Verification commands used throughout

Against PocketIC these are actor calls from the spec rather than `icp canister
call`; the method names and shapes are the same. Shown as CLI for readability, and
they work verbatim against a deployed canister.

```sh
icp canister call backend audit_log_recent '(null, 25 : nat)'
icp canister call backend orphans_unresolved '(null, 50)'
icp canister call backend get_order '("<orderId>")'
icp canister call backend order_for_payment '("pi_...")'
icp canister call backend delivery_journal '("<orderId>")'
icp canister call backend receipt '("<orderId>")'           # owner identity only
```

---

## A. Signature and transport

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Valid signature accepted | any real forwarded event | `200`; event appears in `audit_log` |
| A2 | Tampered body rejected | `stripe listen` + edit the body in a replayed `curl` with the original signature | `400`, nothing in state |
| A3 | Missing signature header | `curl` the route with no `Stripe-Signature` | `400` |
| A4 | **Unprovisioned secret → Stripe retries and later succeeds** | deploy fresh, do **not** set the secret, pay; then set the secret and wait for Stripe's retry | first delivery `503`; the retry delivers. Proves the retry contract we rely on |
| A5 | Secret rotation overlap | `set_webhook_secret` with a new value while a delivery is in flight | no lost event; `webhook_secret_status.generation` increments |
| A6 | Clock drift rejected | skew the host clock >5 min, deliver | `400`. Restore the clock afterwards |

## B. Attribution (claimed, not trusted)

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Happy path | open the order's `stripeSessionUrl`, card `4242 4242 4242 4242` | order → `#paid`; → `#delivered` |
| B2 | No reference | `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed` | `200`; `#unattributed`, `claimedRef` empty |
| B3 | Forged owner | hand-edit the ref to another principal, same order id | `#unattributed` — "claimed owner does not match" |
| B4 | Malformed reference | ref = `garbage` | `#unattributed` — "malformed" |
| B5 | Payment for an **expired** order | there is no TTL to shorten — open the order's session URL, expire that session in the Stripe Dashboard so `checkout.session.expired` arrives, then pay a *previously opened* copy of the page | `200`; order **stays `Expired`**, `#unattributed` whose detail says "cannot be paid". **Refund it in Stripe.** Not honoured — expiry is terminal |
| B6 | Payment for a **cancelled** order | `cancel_order`, then pay a page you opened before cancelling | `200`; order **stays `Cancelled`**, the same refundable obligation. The buyer's decision wins; the money is refundable, never converted against it. ⚠️ Hard to reach on purpose: cancel expires the session on Stripe *first*, so the payment usually cannot start at all |
| B7 | There is no rescue lever | — | there is no attribution rescue. For B5 and B6 the only remedy is a refund in Stripe, which auto-resolves the entry |

## C. Amount honouring

⚠️ **Three of these five rows are optional once the fixtures are captured, and one should be dropped.**
They were written when crafted JSON was our only description of Stripe. The parity test in
`test/integration/src/fixtures.spec.ts` now compares a **recorded real** session against the
crafted builder on exactly the fields this group questions — `amount_total`, `currency`,
`payment_status`, `payment_intent` — so the shape question is automated and the crafted
guard tests inherit its credibility.

| row | now | why |
|---|---|---|
| **C1** | **required** | the happy path; covered by any real purchase |
| **C4** | **required** | reachable with no tampering, and nothing else covers the ceiling's one live case |
| C2, C5 | optional | the field question is automated; a hand-made session adds the HTTP path and ordering, not the shape |
| C3 | **drop** | its own row says it is not a separate outcome — it *is* C2 |

A manual plan ages against the automation built beside it. The rows to re-read first are the
ones whose justification is about **what we cannot otherwise know**, because that is the
claim automation invalidates.

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
⚠️ **The canister sets the amount on the session**, so C2 and
C3 can no longer be produced through the app at all — which is the point of the
change, and is why they are listed as *unreachable* rather than dropped. To
exercise the mismatch branch you have to create a session outside the app (a
hand-made `POST /v1/checkout/sessions` at a different `unit_amount`, carrying an
order's `client_reference_id`) — worth doing once, because it is the branch that
used to deliver silently.

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Exact quoted amount | pay the order's own session | `lockedCycles` verbatim; `paidUsdCents == pricing.usdCents` |
| C2 | **Different amount** | not reachable through the app — hand-make a session at another `unit_amount` with the order's reference | `200`; **nothing delivered**, order stays `Created`, a refundable obligation naming both figures |
| C3 | Below the fee floor | same, at e.g. $0.31 | the same obligation as C2 — "below the floor" is not a separate outcome, it is just a different amount |
| C4 | Above the per-purchase ceiling | lower `maxPurchaseUsdCents` below an existing order's amount, then pay that order's session | A refundable obligation, **nothing delivered**. This is the ceiling's one reachable case, and it needs no tampering |
| C5 | Wrong currency | not reachable through the app — the request pins `usd`; hand-make a EUR session | `#unattributed` — "unexpected currency" |

## D. Dedup and replay

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Resend one event | `stripe events resend <evt_...>` — the event id is on the Dashboard's event page. ⚠️ **NOT the Dashboard's own "Resend"**: that acts on a delivery attempt to a *registered* endpoint, and this plan's only transport is `stripe listen`, which is a live subscription with no endpoint and no attempt record. On a sandbox run there is no Resend button to find. (RUNBOOK §6's Dashboard instruction is for a deployment, which does have a registered endpoint.) | `200 duplicate event`; **no** second credit |
| D2 | Two genuine payments | pay the same link twice (two intents) | second → `#duplicate` |
| D3 | Same intent, new event id | resend after >7 days if you can arrange it, else trust D1 | `200 already credited`, `stripe.replayedAfterPruning` |
| D4 | Credited elsewhere | not reachable through the app — nothing but the webhook writes an attribution. To force it, deliver a hand-made `completed` for order Y carrying an intent already credited to order X | nothing delivered; `stripe.creditedElsewhere` + a `#duplicate` naming both |

## E. Refunds — the highest-value group

These exercise the bug that survived three review rounds. **Use real Stripe
refunds, not crafted events** — the whole point is confirming Stripe's
`amount`/`amount_refunded` semantics match what the code assumes.

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Full refund of an unattributed payment | B2, then refund it fully in the Dashboard | the entry **auto-resolves** |
| E2 | **Partial refund** | refund e.g. $1 of a $5 charge | entry stays **OPEN**; `stripe.refundPartial`; **no** `refundUnmatched` line |
| E3 | Partial then completed | refund the remaining $4 | entry now resolves |
| E4 | Two partials summing to full | $2 then $3 | resolves on the second — Stripe's `amount_refunded` is cumulative |
| E5 | Refund **after delivery** | deliver an order, then refund | `#refundAfterDelivery` with `refundedCents` and `fullRefund` set; never auto-resolves |
| E6 | Refund of an escalated order | force an escalation, then refund | `stripe.refundOfEscalated`, not "pipeline may be mid-flight" |

## F. Async / delayed payment methods

The code assumes `checkout.session.completed` with `payment_status != "paid"`,
then `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`. **Verify Stripe really sends
that sequence** — a unit test previously encoded a wrong assumption here.

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Delayed method settles | enable a delayed method (SEPA debit / `customer_balance`) on a test link and pay | first event `200 ignored`, order stays `#created`, `stripe.unpaidSession`; on settlement → `#paid` |
| F2 | Delayed method fails | trigger `async_payment_failed` | order stays payable; intent not consumed |
| F3 | Out-of-order arrival | if you can force settlement before `completed` | still delivers exactly once |

## G. Event types and configuration

| # | Scenario | How | Expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Unhandled type | subscribe `payment_intent.succeeded`, trigger it | `200 ignored` + `stripe.unhandledType`. **Never** 4xx. ⚠️ This case used `charge.dispute.created`, which the canister now **handles** (`stripe.disputeCreated`, audit-only) — so it stopped exercising the unhandled path and would fail on its own expectation. It needs a type the dispatcher genuinely does not know |
| G2 | **No `payment_intent`** | a 100%-off promo code, or a subscription-mode link | `200` + `#unprocessable`; a resend does **not** duplicate it |
| G3 | Livemode mismatch | point a **test** secret at a canister set to `opt true` | nothing delivered; `stripe.livemodeMismatch`; no obligation queued |
| G4 | Live-on-test | the reverse | nothing delivered, but an obligation **is** queued, keeping the real reference |
| G5 | Mode unset | clear it with `set_expected_livemode '(null)'`, pay | delivers, plus `stripe.livemodeUnset` on every payment |

## H. Frontend — only what a machine cannot do

**Most of this group is now automated.** `main.ts` has a jsdom suite against the
real `index.html` body, and `test/browser/` drives a production build in Chromium
with committed screenshot baselines. Re-checking those by hand is wasted time; what
is left below is the part no suite can reach.

Automated, and where — do **not** repeat these manually:

| Was | Now covered by |
|---|---|
| H1 tier buttons show a cycle estimate, not a tier id | `main.test.ts` |
| H2 the estimate names what lands, and the deposit fee is disclosed once | `main.test.ts` + `layout.spec.ts` |
| the form offers no destination question, and none of its old inputs exist | `layout.spec.ts` (`toHaveCount(0)`, so `display:none` cannot satisfy it) |
| a crafted order for someone else's account, or a non-default subaccount, is refused | `gateway.spec.ts` scenario 61 — the canister's refusal, which no UI test can show |
| H3 fee breakdown accounts for every cent, "operator margin: none" | `main.test.ts` |
| H5 a moved quote asks for confirmation, and the second click goes through | `main.test.ts` |
| H6 cancel appears only pre-payment | `main.test.ts` |
| H7 the receipt recomputes and reports a match | `main.test.ts` + `delivered.spec.ts` |
| the delivered view, the CLI page and its five commands, unknown order ids | `delivered.spec.ts`, through a fixture that replaces only the backend. ⚠️ The step strip, the collapsed facts and "buy again" are **gone**, not covered — asserted absent rather than hidden |
| paint: same-colour text, occlusion, opacity | five screenshot baselines, zero tolerance |

Still needs a human, and this is the list to work:

| # | Scenario | Expect | 2026-08-13 |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **Real sign-in**, local Internet Identity at `http://id.ai.localhost:8000` | a passkey registers and the header shows a shortened principal. No suite can drive a passkey | ✅ |
| H2 | **The deployed asset canister**, not a static build | the page reads its backend id and root key from the real `ic_env` cookie and prices from the real canister. The browser suite serves `dist-fixtures` over a static server, so this path is only ever exercised by hand | ✅ |
| H3 | **The real Stripe hosted Checkout page** | Stripe has no headless path; `stripe trigger` gets you a signed event but never the page | ✅ |
| H4 | **The CLI page's commands actually work** | five steps at `#/cli`, reached from `#order-next-link` on a delivered order or from the dashboard. Run them in order and stop at the first that does not do what the page says. ⚠️ **Step 1 is a prerequisite, not advice:** turn CLI access on at [id.ai](https://id.ai) → settings, or step 2's sign-in page answers "CLI access not enabled" and never returns an identity. Then `icp identity link web cyclepay-id --app <host>`, `icp identity default cyclepay-id`, `icp identity principal` (must equal the principal beside it), `icp cycles balance` (must equal the figure beside it), `icp deploy -e ic`. ⚠️ **No `--identity` flag on the verify commands, and that is the point** — step 2 made it the default, and passing the flag would verify an identity the later commands do not use | ❌ **not run** — supersedes the `dev`-identity version of this row, which named an identity and a route that no longer exist |
| H5 | **The cycles are really there** | `icp cycles balance --of-principal <that principal>` shows the delivered quantity | ✅ 18.2 T for two orders |
| H6 | Order history across a **real** sign-out and sign-in | the table repopulates; a reopened order still shows its timeline | not run |
| H7 | Typography, hierarchy, and the italic rule | `brand-lint.sh` covers banned characters, vocabulary and hardcoded colour. The rest needs eyes | not run |

**H4 is the one that still matters most.** H5 proves the cycles exist at the
buyer's principal; H4 is what proves a buyer can *become* that principal from the
CLI and spend them. Until it passes, the last step of the product's promise —
"link the CLI, deploy" — is unverified end to end.

⚠️ **Two of its steps are unverifiable by any suite, which is why it is here and not
automated.** The id.ai CLI-access switch is a setting in someone else's product, and the
delegation the link command returns needs a real browser sign-in. The page's own
assertions cover only that the right commands are rendered, in order, with the values
this page shows.

## I. Fixture capture — do this while you are in there

Save the **raw request bodies** (Dashboard → event → the JSON) and commit them as
integration fixtures:

- `checkout.session.completed` — paid, with a reference
- `checkout.session.completed` — `payment_status: unpaid`
- `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`
- `charge.refunded` — full **and** partial
- a `payment_intent: null` session (G2)
- `charge.dispute.created`

Then assert the real bodies parse to the same values as the crafted ones. That
converts "our reading of the docs" into "the actual wire format", permanently.

---

## How this relates to `RUNBOOK.md`

They answer different questions and neither replaces the other:

| | This plan | `RUNBOOK.md` |
|---|---|---|
| Question | *Does this build behave correctly?* | *How do I operate a live system?* |
| When | **once**, before the rail carries money — and again after material changes to it | continuously, especially during incidents |
| Audience | whoever is validating the build | the on-call operator |
| Output | a green run, plus captured fixtures | a resolved incident |

The plan is a **precondition** to `docs/OPERATE.md`'s Mode 3: that procedure assumes
the rail has already been shown to work.

⚠️ **Configuration is not duplicated, and the two scripts own different halves.**
`scripts/stripe-dev.sh` sets only the two Stripe-side values: `expected_livemode =
false`, and the forwarding session's signing secret. `scripts/local-dev-seed.sh` owns
the money levers, and it sets the **mainnet** delivery timeline (2 h alert, 72 h max
hold) rather than dev values — so on a local `icp network` the delay path needs two
hours of patience or a hand-called `set_delivery_config`.
⚠️ **Only the PocketIC harness shortens it**, to a 2-minute alert (`sandbox.ts`),
which is why that is the harness to reach for when you want to *see* a delay alert.
Neither script sets an order TTL: the deadline is the Stripe session's own, and
nothing local shortens it. `docs/OPERATE.md`'s Mode 3
is the sole authority for go-live configuration.

Where this plan states an *expected outcome* (a queued obligation, a `#unprocessable`,
a `stripe.refundPartial`), `RUNBOOK.md` §6 states what to *do* about it. That makes
the run a useful check on the runbook itself: if a scenario here produces an entry
whose §6 row is missing, wrong, or unfollowable, the runbook is the thing to fix —
that is exactly how the "failed 25 times" and missing `transferRejected` rows were
found.

## What this cannot tell you

**A green run on this plan is not go-live approval.** It closes the biggest
*unknown*, not the remaining *known* gaps:

1. **Sandbox ≠ live.** No real Radar rules, no real 3DS challenges, no payout
   mechanics, no account-restriction behaviour. Only a mainnet deploy in **live**
   mode shows those, and disputes cannot be rehearsed at all.
2. **Disputes produce no on-chain signal.** Only `charge.refunded` is subscribed.
   A lost chargeback is invisible to the canister — accepted, documented, and
   managed by Dashboard vigilance.
3. **The SEV-SNP question is RESOLVED** (owner, 2026-09-11). Memory encryption
   protects RAM, and checkpoint-to-disk and state-sync between nodes are confidential
   on the target subnet as well — which was the part that mattered, since either in
   the clear would have leaked the webhook secret and made SEV worthless. It was the
   single most consequential open item and no Stripe test could touch it.
   `RUNBOOK.md` §9 carries the checklist; **attestation coverage** of every replica
   is the sub-item still open there.
4. **Flat controller allowlist.** Any one controller can upgrade-then-drain. An
   honest trust model, but it is the model you would launch with.
5. ~~**The reproducible-build gate has never run against a real deployment.**~~ **Closed:**
   `v0.1.0-beta.1` was built in the pinned container, installed from that artifact, and the
   install gated on the canister reporting the hash that was built. ⚠️ What remains is that
   `backend.wasm` depends on the build architecture, so a hash is only comparable against a
   rebuild on the architecture the release names — `docs/VERIFY.md` carries that limit.
6. **No monitoring exists.** Every safety mechanism here is a number someone has
   to go and look at; an alert nobody receives is not an alert. **`RUNBOOK.md` §8
   owns the plan** — metric table with thresholds and severities, and the reason the
   **reserve balance** has to be *pushed* rather than polled. Wire it before taking
   money.
7. **No external security audit** (spec §8 explicitly does not gate v1 on one).
8. **The deferred tail**, all real and none money-losing: gate-config/tier
   cross-check, `let #ii(owner)` trap, counts-map reconcile, the once-per-order
   alert keeping its first stall text.

### The honest bar

Phases A and B green ⇒ **the Stripe integration works as coded, and money-out
works against real NNS canisters.** That is the engineering bar.

Production also needs items 3 and 6 resolved — secret confidentiality and
monitoring — plus a deliberate decision to accept 1, 2, 4 and 7. Those are
judgement calls for the operator, not tests that can pass.
