# What a purchase actually buys

**The scenario:** someone buys cycles here to create and deploy **two canisters** — a
backend and a frontend — and run them for **two weeks to a month**, syncing assets and
upgrading the backend wasm **about three times a day**, on a **13-node** application subnet.

**The answer:** they need **4.0 T upfront** and consume **~1.34 T** over the month. The
upfront figure decides sufficiency: **$10 covers it 1.7×, $5 does not cover it at all.**

## Upfront and consumed are different numbers

⚠️ **Compare a purchase against `upfront`, not against `consumed`.** They differ by 3× here,
and only the first decides whether a buyer can get started.

```
UPFRONT   icp canister create --cycles default   2.000 T per canister
          × 2 canisters                         4.000 T   ← the gate
            of which protocol creation fee      1.000 T   consumed
            of which lands as canister balance  3.000 T   still the buyer's

CONSUMED  protocol creation fee, 2 canisters    1.000 T
          90 deploys (3/day × 30 days)          0.321 T
          storage, 50 MB across both, 30 days   0.015 T
                                                ───────
                                                1.337 T   ($1.84)
```

Only the total carries a USD figure: the parts are rounded to three decimals and summing
them gives 1.336, while the exact total is 1_336_571_944_520 cycles.

⚠️ **`--cycles` defaults to `2000000000000`, documented only in `icp canister create
--help`.** `icp deploy` inherits it silently, so a buyer who never reads that flag still
needs 2 T per canister. It is the largest number in the model. Those cycles are not *spent*
— they land in the canister as its balance and remain the buyer's — but they must be held to
create the canister at all.

Delivered cycles are directly spendable on this: delivery is an `icrc1_transfer` on the
**cycles ledger**, and `icp canister create` funds from the cycles ledger by default —
`--with-icp` is the alternative that routes through the CMC instead.

Two weeks rather than a month consumes ~1.16 T; the upfront figure does not move, because
creation does not scale with duration. After a month the two canisters still hold about
**2.664 T** between them, separate from whatever is unspent in the buyer's wallet.

## Where the figures come from

Documented **13-node application subnet** rates —
<https://docs.internetcomputer.org/references/cycles-cost-formulas>:

| | 13-node cost |
|---|---|
| Create a canister | 500,000,000,000 (0.5 T) |
| Storage | 127,000 per GiB per second |
| Ingress message | 1,200,000 base + **2,000 per byte** |
| Update call execution | 5,000,000 base + 1 per instruction |

Sizes are this repo's own artifacts, as a stand-in for "a small app": the backend wasm is
**1,165,653 bytes** and the built frontend is **612,831 bytes** across 8 files.

⚠️ **Price cycles off the REAL XDR/USD rate.** `Pricing.mo` computes
`cycles = netCents × xdrPermyriadPerIcp / usdPerIcpMicros`, so **ICP cancels** — it is an
intermediate unit, not an input to how many cycles a dollar buys. What remains is XDR/USD,
and cycles mint at 1 T = 1 XDR. The §3 **test vector** (3.5 XDR/ICP ÷ $4.55/ICP = 0.769
XDR/USD) is a fixture running ~5.6% generous, and `test/browser`'s baselines are generated
from it — so agreement with a baseline says nothing about the real figure. Figures below use
the IMF rate for 2026-09-10: **1 XDR = $1.373470**, $1.00 = 0.728083 XDR.

⚠️ **Two subnets that are NOT the buyer's.**

- **This gateway's own canister** targets a 7-node confidential subnet, where these
  costs scale by 7/13 ≈ 0.54. That affects *our* gas, not a buyer's app.
- **A local `icp network` prices differently.** Solving two observations of this repo's
  backend (7.7 MB → 1,061,634,457 idle cycles/day; 336.7 MB → 9,465,058,545) gives 317,500
  cycles/GiB/s and a flat 10,000 cycles/s per canister — 2.5× the documented storage rate,
  plus a baseline the mainnet tables do not list. Local burn overstates a buyer's bill.

## What each tier buys

Using the canister's own integer fee arithmetic (`feeBps` 290, `feeFixedCents` 30):

| tier | net | cycles | covers the 4.0 T upfront? | spare |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **$5.00** | $4.55 | **3.313 T** | **NO** — short 0.69 T | — |
| $10.00 | $9.41 | **6.851 T** | yes, 1.7× | +2.851 T |
| $20.00 | $19.12 | 13.921 T | yes, 3.5× | +9.921 T |
| $50.00 | $48.25 | 35.130 T | yes, 8.8× | +31.130 T |

⚠️ **`Pricing.feeCents` CEILINGS the basis-point part** — `(gross × bps + 9_999) / 10_000` —
so $5 nets 455¢ rather than the 456¢ a floored reading gives. $5 is the only tier where the
two differ.

`test/buyer-cost.test.mo` asserts every figure in this table against `Pricing.feeCents` and
`Pricing.cyclesForCents`, and compares the fee constants to `Pricing.defaultConfig()`. So a
**formula** change fails there with the tier that moved, and a **configuration** change
fails the comparison — which is the only place in the repo those two constants are pinned.

At $10 the buyer holds ~5.5 T across wallet and canisters after the first month — roughly
sixteen further months of the same three-deploys-a-day pattern.

## Why $10 rather than $5

The floor has **two independent justifications**, and both hold:

1. **Sufficiency.** $5 buys 3.313 T against a 4.0 T upfront requirement. A $5 buyer creates
   the first canister and fails on the second, holding 1.31 T against a 2 T request — a
   failure that surfaces from `icp deploy`, with nothing pointing back at the purchase being
   too small.
2. **Fee share.** The fixed 30¢ is regressive: **9.0%** of a $5 purchase against **5.9%** of
   a $10 one, so the buyer's effective price rises from **$1.46/T to $1.51/T**, which is
   visible on the receipt.

A $5 floor works **only** if the buyer tunes `--cycles` down — at ~600 B each (protocol fee
plus freezing reserve plus slack) the upfront need falls to ~1.2 T and $5 clears it 2.8×.
That is a real path and not the default one.

⚠️ **There is no operator loss at either tier.** `Pricing` derives cycles from **netCents**,
so Stripe's cut is recovered *from the buyer*, not absorbed. Unrecovered per-order cost is
the HTTPS outcall (~220 M cycles at 13 nodes) plus the ledger transfer fee, ~320 M cycles
≈ **$0.0004**. Per-order overhead does not scale with purchase size, which is what
`Gate.mo`'s "worth an outcall and a reserve hold" refers to.

## The cost shape, and the one thing that breaks it

**Storage is a rounding error** at small-app scale — 50 MB across both canisters for a month
is 2 cents, a full gibibyte-month is $0.45. Count creations and uploads, not storage.

**The recurring cost is upload bytes.** At 2,000 cycles/byte every megabyte costs 2 G, so a
deploy costs 3.57 G and tracks *artifact size* rather than deploy frequency — the two
update-call base fees are 10 M of that 3,570 M. The 90-full-syncs figure is a worst case:
the asset sync uploads only changed files.

⚠️ **`install_code` execution is the only term that can dominate, and it is not measured
here.** At 1 cycle per instruction:

| instructions per upgrade | per deploy | 90 deploys | consumed, 30d |
|---|---|---|---|
| base only (modelled) | 3.57 G | 0.321 T | 1.337 T |
| 100 M — light | 3.67 G | 0.330 T | 1.346 T |
| 1 B — moderate | 4.57 G | 0.411 T | 1.427 T |
| 10 B — heavy | 13.57 G | 1.221 T | 2.237 T |
| **200 B — the install limit** | 203.57 G | **18.321 T** | **19.337 T** |

The realistic band for a small app is light-to-moderate, under 10% of the total. The limit
row is the shape of the only failure mode: instruction-heavy upgrades three times a day can
exceed a $10 purchase, and nothing in the storage or upload arithmetic hints at it.

### The freezing threshold

Each canister retains 30 days of its own idle cost (`freezing_threshold = 2_592_000`
seconds) and stops executing rather than spending into it. At the documented 13-node
storage rate, idle cost is storage cost, so the reserve is a function of stored data:

| canister memory | idle | reserve locked |
|---|---|---|
| 1 MB | 0.010 B/day | **0.31 B cycles** |
| 10 MB | 0.102 B/day | **3.07 B cycles** |
| 50 MB | 0.511 B/day | **15.33 B cycles** |
| 100 MB | 1.022 B/day | **30.66 B cycles** |
| 500 MB | 5.110 B/day | **153.29 B cycles** |
| 1024 MB | 10.464 B/day | **313.93 B cycles** |

⚠️ **Locked rather than spendable, and it grows with stored data** — but at small-app scale
it is under 0.1 T per canister, well inside the 2 T each one is created with. It changes no
verdict here; it matters when a canister's balance is being run down deliberately, because
"the balance says 0.1 T" and "0.1 T is available" are different claims.

⚠️ Do not read these off a local network. The flat per-canister baseline there dominates at
small sizes — a 1.3 MB canister shows a reserve **67× larger** than this table gives.

### Sensitivity

The documented storage rate is presented as already scaled to 13 nodes. If it were per-node
instead, storage is 13× higher — 0.199 T for the same 50 MB, a 1.520 T consumed total. The
verdict is unchanged at every tier, because storage is the smallest term either way.

## Reproducing this

```python
CLI_DEFAULT, CREATE_FEE = 2_000_000_000_000, 500_000_000_000
STORAGE, IB, IBY, UB    = 127_000, 1_200_000, 2_000, 5_000_000
XDR_PER_USD             = 0.728083          # IMF — check it, it moves
WASM, ASSETS, DAYS, PER_DAY = 1_165_653, 612_831, 30, 3
CANISTERS = 2

deploy   = (IB + IBY*WASM + UB) + (IB + IBY*ASSETS + UB)
storage  = STORAGE * (50e6 / 2**30) * 86400 * DAYS
upfront  = CANISTERS * CLI_DEFAULT
consumed = CANISTERS * CREATE_FEE + deploy*DAYS*PER_DAY + storage

def buys(gross_cents):                      # mirrors Pricing.feeCents — note the CEILING
    net = gross_cents - ((gross_cents*290 + 9_999)//10_000 + 30)
    return net/100 * XDR_PER_USD

print("upfront  %.3f T" % (upfront/1e12))
print("consumed %.3f T" % (consumed/1e12))
for tier in (500, 1000):
    print("$%.2f -> %.3f T  covers upfront: %s"
          % (tier/100, buys(tier), buys(tier) >= upfront/1e12))
```

Swap `WASM`/`ASSETS` for the app being priced, `CANISTERS` for its shape, and add an
instruction estimate to `deploy` if its upgrades do real work on install.

⚠️ **`buys()` is a transcription of `Pricing.feeCents`, so running this checks the cost side
and NOT whether the tier figures match the canister.** The authority for those is
`test/buyer-cost.test.mo`, which calls `Pricing.feeCents` and `Pricing.cyclesForCents`
directly. Change a fee constant and this snippet keeps agreeing with itself; that suite
fails with the tier that moved.
