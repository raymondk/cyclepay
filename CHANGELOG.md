# Changelog

Notable changes per release. A release is a tag plus the module hashes published with it
— see [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md), whose procedure refuses to cut a version that has no
entry here.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with a pre-release suffix while this is not yet handling
real money.

## Unreleased

**Frontend verification is one check over the whole served surface.**
`scripts/check-frontend-hash.py` compares the canister's `state_hash` against one computed
from a local `src/frontend/dist` by the verifier the pinned certified-assets release
ships, and replaces the per-asset content comparison. The hash covers every asset's bytes
in every encoding, its `content_type` and response headers, and the redirect rules in
match order, so header and routing drift now fail the check; the comparison it replaces
read asset bytes only, and could not see a drifted CSP. It needs a Rust toolchain on first
run, and refuses to compare unless the canister's `version()` matches the
`@dfinity/static-site` pin in `icp.yaml`.

**A release publishes that hash.** The procedure tells a verifier to build a tag, so the
notes now carry the number that tag produces and the certified-assets release it was
computed under. `release.sh` builds the frontend from the ref in a worktree rather than
from the working tree, the way the backend is already built from a `git archive` of it.

**The pinned BLS12-381 port is faster and renamed.** `vendor/icp-seeding-secrets-poc` moves
to a version whose field arithmetic uses Barrett reduction and shift-based bit access, so
decrypting a sealed secret costs about 3.1 billion instructions rather than 5.4. The
package is now `ic-bls12-381`. Behaviour is unchanged: the same 102 reference vectors pass,
alongside 6 new ones, and the interface and stable shape are untouched. The backend module
hash changes.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

First tagged release. The gateway was already running on mainnet in **simulation mode**,
deployed untagged and with no published hash; this release replaces that module with one
whose bytes are published and reproducible.

**What it is.** Buy cycles with a credit card, on-chain: one Motoko backend canister and
one certified-assets frontend, no server. Cycles are sold from a reserve the canister
already holds, priced from the Exchange Rate Canister and the CMC with no outbound HTTPS
in the pricing path, and delivered by one `icrc1_transfer` to the buyer's cycles-ledger
account.

**Simulation mode.** `pricing_status().config.divisor` scales delivered cycles; `1` is
production. Cards are charged in Stripe's sandbox, and buying requires an allow-listed
principal, so a funded gateway cannot be drained by free test payments.

**Verifiability.** This is the first build published with module hashes.
`scripts/release.sh` builds in a digest-pinned container, installs that artifact, and
gates on the canister reporting the hash it built, so the published bytes and the running
bytes cannot drift apart. The container is
`ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env-motoko:v2.2.1`, pinned by digest. The frontend is checked
against a local build too. Rebuild the tag and check both yourself —
[`docs/VERIFY.md`](docs/VERIFY.md) has the commands.

**Known limits, stated in `docs/VERIFY.md`:** any single controller can upgrade and drain;
the webhook secret is plaintext canister state protected by the confidential subnet; the
mops migration chain is not in place, so a stable-shape change still needs a reinstall.
