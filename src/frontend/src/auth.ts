// environment branching in production, and users always see the real II UI. The
// /authorize path is mandatory in 7.x (the URL is used verbatim; without it the
// popup opens the II homepage and never returns).
//
// `VITE_II_URL` overrides it for a fully local environment — PocketIC can deploy
// its own II (`ii` ICP feature) at the mainnet id, and `npm run sandbox` prints the
// URL to build against. Test-only: production leaves it unset and gets mainnet II.
