/// Candid **text** for `icp canister call`, and the typed command table.

/// **Why a table of per-method renderers rather than one generic value walker**, and
/// not the reason first assumed. The guess was that `opt T` and `vec T` are both arrays
/// in the bindings, making an empty one ambiguous — that is true of the RAW
/// declarations, and false of the actor-enabled ones used here, which map `opt T` to
/// `T | null` and leave `vec T` as `T[]`. No ambiguity to resolve.
///
/// The real reason is coupling: each renderer's parameters come from
/// `Parameters<Backend[M]>`, so the table is tied to the canister's interface. A generic
/// walker takes `unknown` and would happily format a signature that changed underneath
/// it.
///
/// ⚠️ **Every renderer is typed off the actor, never off a string template.** A
/// rendered `icp canister call` is a hand-written mirror of the canister's interface —
/// the shape this repo keeps out of its test suite — and it fails asymmetrically: a
/// wrong argument is refused loudly, a signature that changed underneath produces a
/// command that runs and does the wrong thing. `Parameters<Backend[M]>` makes that a
/// typecheck failure instead.
///
/// ⚠️ **The two secret setters are permanently absent** and it is not an oversight:
/// `set_webhook_secret` and `set_stripe_api_key` are excluded because a rendered
/// command containing the key would land in a page's DOM and clipboard. The console
/// shows only their `*_status` reads. `scripts/check-admin-commands.py` fails if either
/// ever appears here.
