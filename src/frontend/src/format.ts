/// `WithdrawArgs` and `CreateCanisterArgs` have no `memo` field, so on those paths the
/// LEDGER writes the memo and a caller cannot forge it. `TransferArgs` and `DepositArgs`
/// do take a caller-supplied memo. Decoding memos wherever they appear would let anyone
/// send this account a transfer memoed `FE * 32` and have this app announce "Created a
/// canister" in a history the buyer reconciles against.
///
/// **A creation tells you THAT, never WHICH.** The created id comes back in
/// `CreateCanisterSuccess.canister_id`, the method reply, and never enters the block. So
/// `#creation` carries no principal and no later read can recover one.
///
/// ⚠️ **ATTEMPTED, not succeeded, and the names say so deliberately.** A `create_canister`
/// that FAILS writes the same `FE * 32` burn (`CreateCanisterError.FailedToCreate` carries
/// a `fee_block`), and a `withdraw` that fails writes the same `CBOR[target]` burn
/// (`FailedToWithdraw.fee_block`). Both were measured, against a nonexistent subnet and a
/// nonexistent canister. The burn is the CHARGE, not the outcome, so labelling either
/// "Created" or "Topped up" claims an outcome the block cannot support.
///
/// The outcome shows only in the REFUND that follows: a failed creation mints back with
/// memo `FD * 32`, a failed withdraw with `FF * 32`. This module deliberately does NOT
/// decode those. `DepositArgs` takes a caller-supplied memo and a deposit IS a mint, so
