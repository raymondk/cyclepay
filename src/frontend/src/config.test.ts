/// one jsdom does not reach on its own: `window.location.hostname` is `localhost` under
/// vitest, so a test that did not pass a hostname would assert the LOCAL branch twice and
/// report the mainnet behaviour as covered.
/// ⚠️ **Passed in, not seeded through a cookie.** `safeGetCanisterEnv` reads nothing under
/// jsdom -- probed, both the plain and the `%5F`-encoded on-wire shapes return
/// `undefined` -- so a test that set `document.cookie` would exercise the
/// `frontendId === undefined` branch and report the mainnet path as covered. The cookie
/// path is load-bearing for the backend id too, so the whole app fails visibly if it
/// breaks; what needs asserting here is the branch and the string.
