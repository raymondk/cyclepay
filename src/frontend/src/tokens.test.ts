/// Text tokens must be readable against the ground they sit on, in BOTH themes.
///
/// **A contrast failure is invisible from the CSS**, which is why it is measured here
/// rather than reviewed. A muted grey on the parchment ground can sit at 3.71:1 —
/// clearing only the large-text bar while `.muted` is 0.875rem prose all over the app —
/// and the detector is otherwise a person saying the light theme is hard to read.
///
/// **Both themes are measured, because they are tuned from the same brand values and
/// drift apart.** One mode can be correct while the other is not, with nothing recording
/// which. That asymmetry is what this file exists to catch.
/// ⚠️ **What this suite CANNOT see: opacity composition.** It measures a token against
/// a token, and `opacity` composites on top of the result afterwards — so a rule like
/// `.flow-step { opacity: 0.55 }` (`styles.css:1125`) makes text render at a ratio this
/// file never computes. Measured on the landing page's four-step rail:
///
///   light   --icp-fg-muted      5.15:1  →  2.19:1 at 0.55
///           --icp-fg-secondary  8.54:1  →  2.74:1
///   dark    --icp-fg-muted      5.25:1  →  2.41:1
///           --icp-fg-secondary  9.98:1  →  3.78:1
///
/// That rail is deliberate — 0.55 is the trough of an 8 s cycle that brings each step to
/// full opacity, and `prefers-reduced-motion` sets `opacity: 1` with `animation: none`.
/// It is recorded here because a green run of this file was cited as covering
/// "text the same colour as its background", and for anything faded it does not.
///
/// ⚠️ **What DOES cover it: `test/browser/visual.spec.ts`.** Playwright's
/// `animations: "disabled"` cancels an infinite animation to its initial state, and the
/// `0%` keyframe is the 0.55 trough — so the committed baselines pin the DIMMEST frame,
/// and a change that faded the rail further fails there. The two suites are complements:
/// this one is exact about tokens and blind to composition; that one sees the composed
/// pixels and cannot tell you a ratio.
