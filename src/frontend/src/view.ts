/// destination form, active order, history, explainers, all in one column. One
/// view at a time makes the next action unambiguous, which matters most for the
/// audience that has never done this before.
///
/// `delivered` is not a separate route. It is the `order` route rendered for an
/// order that has arrived, because that is a property of the order rather than of
/// where the visitor navigated.
///
/// `admin` is the operator console. It is a view rather than a separate page for
/// the same reason as the others: one owner of the screen, and hash routing that cannot
/// 404 on reload from an asset canister.
///
/// ⚠️ Deliberately not ADVERTISED: a console link on a purchase page is noise for every
/// visitor who is not an operator.
///
/// Since the header gained `#admin-nav` that rule is implemented rather than abandoned —
/// the link renders only when `admin_status` says the caller is granted or is a
/// controller, so the visitors it would be noise for never see it. What changed is that
/// an operator no longer has to know to type `#/admin`.
/// `cli` is the post-delivery guidance: linking the CLI and deploying. It is its own
/// view rather than a panel on the order, because those are two different questions.
/// "What did I buy" is a record with numbers and a receipt; "what do I do now" is a
/// sequence of commands. The order view previously answered the second one so loudly
/// that it answered the first not at all: everything numeric sat inside a disclosure
/// that collapsed on exactly the view where the buyer wanted it.
