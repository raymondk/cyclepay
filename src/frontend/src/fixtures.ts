///
/// **Why this exists.** The delivered view is the flagship surface of this app,
/// and it shipped broken twice. Both times the reason was the same: nothing
/// outside jsdom could reach it. Getting there for real needs a
/// signed-in Internet Identity, a funded local network, a Stripe API key and
/// a signed webhook, so the only pictures anyone ever had of that screen were
/// produced by injecting DOM state directly. A test can pass that way while a
/// visitor sees nothing, which is exactly what happened.
///
/// So this replaces the *backend*, and nothing else. Sign-in, routing, the view
/// machine, the poll and every render run as they do in production; the only thing
/// standing in is what `get_order` answers. That is what makes a spec written
/// against these fixtures evidence about the app rather than about the fixture.
///
/// **Absent from a production build.** The single call site sits behind
/// `if (__FIXTURES__)` in main.ts, which Vite replaces with the literal `false`
/// unless the build sets `CYCLEPAY_FIXTURES=1`, so Rollup drops the branch and
/// this module's dynamic import with it. `scripts/test-all.sh` greps the shipping
/// bundle for the hook's name to keep that claim true rather than assumed.

    // exercise a handful of paths, and implementing forty methods to satisfy an
    // annotation would be worse than the cast. What `satisfies` buys is that every stub
    // that IS here is checked, and a stub name the service does not have is an error.
    // The one remaining assertion is at the boundary, where the partiality is the point.
    // ⚠️ **`Partial` checks SHAPES, not completeness.** A method the app calls and this
    // object lacks compiles fine and fails at runtime with "not a function". That is the
    // right trade, because that failure is loud, whereas the wrong-shape class this
    // replaced was silent: four wrong shapes sat here through three commits with every
    // suite green. Do not read `satisfies Partial<Backend>` as full coverage.
  } satisfies Partial<Backend>;

  // ⚠️ **The `unknown` hop is required here, and the reason is NEITHER of the two I first
  // wrote.** An assertion is legal when either type is assignable to the other. Here
  // neither is, and three probes pin which:
  //
  //   stub as Pick<Backend, 'card_tiers' | 'get_order'>   compiles
  //   stub as Pick<Backend, keyof Backend>                TS2352
  //   stub as Backend                                     TS2352
  //
  // So it is not member COUNT (a 1-of-40 partial asserts to a plain 40-member interface
  // fine), and not `ActorSubclass`'s own structure (`Pick<..., keyof Backend>` strips index
  // and call signatures and still fails). It is that neither direction holds: the stub is
  // missing about thirty members, so stub to Backend fails; and the stub's members have
  // NARROWER inferred types than the service's (`get_order` returns one specific order
  // object, not `Order | null`), so Backend to stub fails too. Picking only the stubbed
  // keys restores one direction, which is why that probe compiles.
  //
  // ⚠️ **The probe that mattered is the one distinguishing this from a real defect.**
  // `satisfies Partial<Backend>` checks stub against Backend, and TypeScript's method
  // parameters are bivariant, so a stub can satisfy it while the service's member is NOT
  // assignable to the stub's: a fifth wrong shape `satisfies` is structurally unable to
  // catch. The Pick-of-stubbed-keys probe compiling is what rules that out.
  //
  // The hop is acceptable because it no longer does any checking: `satisfies` above
  // verifies every stub's signature, and this covers only the partiality. It used to cover
  // everything, which is how four wrong shapes survived three commits with every suite
  // green.
