// DOM-level tests for main.ts.
//
// `main.ts` is ~800 lines of state machine and DOM wiring with no coverage at all:
// format.test.ts only exercises pure functions. The bugs that live here are
// *reaction* bugs — does the acknowledged quote clear when the tier changes, does
// the cancel button disappear once an order is paid, does the second click after a
// #quoteChanged actually go through — and none of them are visible to a typecheck.
//
// The backend is **stubbed on purpose, and that is not a weakness here.** Its
// behaviour is already proven by 67 PocketIC scenarios; re-proving it in jsdom would
// add nothing. What is unproven is the UI's reaction to it, and a stub is the only
// way to drive those reactions deterministically (a #quoteChanged, a rate that moved,
// a delivered order with a matching receipt).
//
// What this cannot show: that the Candid shapes match reality, or that the page
// works in a real browser. Those need Playwright against `pic.makeLive()` — see
// docs/TEST-COVERAGE.md.
