/// Detect and recover from a **stale `ic_env` cookie**, a real failure diagnosed
/// against a running local network.
///
/// The shape of the bug: two `ic_env` cookies for one origin, advertising
/// different backend canister ids. `document.cookie` lists the stale copy first
/// and `safeGetCanisterEnv` takes the first match, so the app builds its actor
/// against a canister that no longer exists and every call fails. Nothing in the
/// UI explains it, the page looks broken, and clearing site data is not something
/// a visitor will guess.
///
/// Two things make this worth code rather than a note in a README:
///   - it presents as "the gateway is down" when the gateway is fine, and
///   - `cookieStore.delete` silently does nothing on a partitioned cookie unless
///     `partitioned: true` is passed, so the obvious cleanup does not work.
///
/// What is **measured**, what is **reported**, and what is **inferred** are kept
/// apart below, each with its source. Three successive versions of this comment
/// stated a guess as fact — including the error code this module keys on, which
/// was wrong for four rounds.
///
/// ── MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// **What a missing canister actually returns.** Probed against a local network
/// (icp-cli 1.2.0, network launcher v15.0.0-2026-07-17-04-19) on 2026-08-10, with
/// `@icp-sdk/core` 5.3, calling a well-formed but unallocated canister id
/// (`e5xzy-miaaa-aaaah-7777q-cai`):
///
///   class:  ProtocolError            (NOT a RejectError, and no reject code)
///   status: HTTP 400 Bad Request
///   body:   error: canister_not_found
///           details: The specified canister does not exist.
///
/// Identical for a query and for an update. **`IC0536` appears nowhere in it.**
///
/// **What IC0536 actually is.** Same probe, calling a method that does not exist
/// on a canister that does:
///
///   class:          RejectError, reject code 5
///   rejectErrorCode: IC0536
///   message:        Canister has no update method 'no_such_method_here'.
///                   …/references/execution-errors#method-not-found
///
/// So the previous `/IC0536/` test matched **method-not-found** and could never
/// match the condition this module exists for. The fallback `/[Cc]anister .* not
/// found/` missed it too: the real body says `canister_not_found` with an
/// underscore, and then "does not exist".
///
/// **`Set-Cookie` from the local gateway.** Complete response header, read on
/// 2026-08-10 from `http://frontend.local.localhost:8000/`:
///
///   set-cookie: ic_env=…; SameSite=Lax
///
/// That is the whole header: no `Path`, no `Max-Age`, no `Secure`, no
/// `Partitioned`. A previous table here claimed `secure; Max-Age=31536000;
/// Path=<certified>` for this row, and none of it was there.
///
/// **Who writes it.** The same response certifies `Set-Cookie`
/// (`ic-certificateexpression` lists it among the certified response headers) and
/// carries `x-ic-canister-id: <frontend>`, so the **asset canister** emits this
/// cookie, not the gateway.
///
/// **The vite dev server's copy**, from this repo: `vite.config.ts`
/// `getDevServerConfig()` sets `ic_env=…; SameSite=Lax;` and nothing else.
///
/// **The resolver takes the first match**, in
/// `@icp-sdk/core/src/agent/canister-env`:
///
///   document.cookie.split(';').find(c => c.trim().startsWith('ic_env='))
///
/// With several cookies present, which one wins is cookie ordering, not anything
/// this app controls.
///
/// ── REPORTED, not measured here ─────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// **The mainnet header**: `ic_env=…; Secure; SameSite=None; Partitioned` — one
/// header, no `Max-Age` and no `Path`. Source: the retraction on
/// **dfinity/icp-js-core#1384**, which corrected an earlier table built by
/// grepping a whole response instead of the `Set-Cookie` line.
///
/// Not measurable from this repo yet, and that is itself measured: `nns.ic0.app`,
/// `identity.internetcomputer.org` and `oc.app` return **no `Set-Cookie` at all**
/// (checked 2026-08-10). `ic_env` is served by the certified-assets canister (and was
/// by the legacy asset canister before it), so
/// seeing it on mainnet needs a canister deployed that way, and this project has
/// not deployed one.
///
/// **A stale cookie shadowing a fresh one.** Diagnosed against a running local
/// network but **not reproduced here**, so the provenance of the duplicate is not
/// established.
///
/// ── INFERRED, untested ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// How two copies come to coexist. A cookie is keyed on (name, domain, path), and
/// a partitioned cookie lives in a separate jar from an unpartitioned one, so a
/// copy written under one configuration can survive beside a fresh one written
/// under another. Cookies ignore the port, so a dev server on `localhost:5173` and
/// a gateway on `localhost:8000` share a jar. Whether the recipe adds `Secure` and
/// `Partitioned` conditionally on https — which is what would make the mainnet and
/// local headers differ at all, given the same canister code emits both — is
/// likewise not established here.
///
/// The guard does not depend on any of that being right: it no-ops unless two
/// cookies advertise *different* backend ids, which is correct everywhere. The
/// real fix belongs upstream, tracked on **dfinity/icp-js-core#1384**: the
/// resolver is in `@icp-sdk/core`.
