/// The audit log — unbounded, append-only operational trail (§4.2).
///
/// **Facts about money live on the objects, not here.** Where an order got to, what the
/// buyer paid, why it expired: all on `Types.Order`. The journal holds the delivery
/// position; the order's `problems` and the orphan list hold open obligations. This is
/// where to look for "what happened around then", never for "what happened to this order".
///
/// A refund is the one money fact deliberately not on the order: it lives in **Stripe**,
/// where it was issued, plus the unresolved `#refundAfterDelivery` problem.
///
/// ## ⚠️ What may be written here — the admission rule
///
/// > **An audit line may be written only where something other than a caller's
/// > willingness to call bounds how often it fires.**
///
/// Qualifying bounds, and they are the only three: **our own timer cadence**, **an
/// authenticated event** (the `stripe.*` lines need the signing secret, so growth is
/// bounded by Stripe rather than by a caller), or **a state transition**
/// (`gate.startedRefusing` fires once when the rail starts refusing, not per refused
/// request).
///
/// **The rule is about frequency, not about what the line describes.** Phrasing it as
/// "records a state change, not a request" excludes legitimate lines — the outcome of our
/// own outbound request is the only detector for a silently non-functioning recovery
/// sweep, and it is bounded by our cadence, not by a caller.
///
/// **Our cadence bounds a RATE, and a rate against an unfixed persistent condition is
/// unbounded over time.** A per-pass line about a condition nobody has fixed is not
/// admissible just because a timer paces it; latch the condition and write once.
///
/// What the rule excludes is a pre-commit refusal line: refusals are free to attempt —
/// one cent from any fresh principal reaches `#amountBelowMin` — so a log fed by a free
/// caller is permanent stable-state growth at zero attacker cost. Every other structure
/// here is attacker-priced. This one is not, so admission is the guard.
///
/// **Adding a tag?** Name the bound. If the honest answer is "a caller decides", it is a
/// counter with a monitoring row, not a line.
///
/// **Nothing is dropped and the `capacity` parameter is gone rather than large**
/// `seq` is monotonic and never reused; with no drops there are no gaps, so a
/// reader holding the last seq it saw can tell new events from an empty interval.
