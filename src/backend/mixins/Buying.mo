///
///   * `createStripeSession` issues the HTTPS outcall — `Call.httpRequest`, and a
///     reference to the actor's own transform function.
///   * `createOrderWithFreshId` calls `management.raw_rand()`, so it needs the

///   * `noteRailClosed` latches a `Gate.RailCondition` and writes an audit line, which
///     the create path shares with the recovery sweep.
///
/// All three stay in the composition root and arrive as closures. That is `A3` read
/// honestly: an endpoint body should be authorize → delegate → map, and the delegate
/// target belongs in the root when it is actor-bound. Passing them also keeps ONE
/// implementation shared with the timers, which is what stops the create path and the
/// sweep from diverging.

/// reads the rate cache and the pricing config and returns arithmetic — no await, no
