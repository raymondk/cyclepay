/// The HTTP surface: the two halves of `http_request` and the outcall transform (§6.0).
///
/// ⚠️ **These three are the only endpoints here that are not authenticated by a caller**,
/// and two of them cannot be: Stripe cannot sign in, and the transform is invoked by the
/// replica. Authentication is on the PAYLOAD instead — the webhook route verifies an
/// HMAC over the body — so the dispatcher re-applies every guard on the update half,
/// because anyone can call it directly through Candid.
///
/// **`routes` and `maxRequestBodyBytes` pass directly and that is safe**, unlike a
/// mutable `var`: both are transient `let`s built during initialisation, which is also
/// when `include` evaluates its arguments, and neither ever changes afterwards. The
/// rule in `docs/DESIGN.md` §9.1 is about MUTABLE state; an immutable snapshot of an
/// immutable value is the value.
///
/// ⚠️ **`paidOrder` is a take-once handoff, not a getter.** The dispatcher sets it inside
/// the update half and this mixin consumes it in the same message; reading and clearing
/// as one operation is what stops a second delivery kick from a stale value, and it is
/// why the accessor is `take` rather than a get/set pair.
