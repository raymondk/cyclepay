/// ⚠️ **State reaches a mixin two different ways and picking the wrong one is silent.**
/// `include` evaluates its arguments ONCE, so:
///
///   * `Secret.Store` is a record of `var` fields — a heap object — so passing it shares
///     it by reference and `Secret.set` writes through to the actor's own field.
///   * `stripeOrigin` is a `var` holding an immutable `?Text`. Passing the field itself
///     would hand this mixin a snapshot taken at include time: `stripe_origin()` would
///     answer `null` forever and `set_stripe_origin` would mutate a copy nobody reads.
///     So it arrives as an accessor pair instead.
///
/// ⚠️ **Accessors rather than a `{ var current : ?Text }` wrapper**, which is the other
/// way to make a `var` shareable. Wrapping changes the actor's STABLE SHAPE — the field
/// stops being `stable var stripeOrigin : ?Text` — and with no migration chain
/// that costs a reinstall. Closures are mixin parameters, never stable state, so
/// `deployed/backend.most` does not move for this split.
