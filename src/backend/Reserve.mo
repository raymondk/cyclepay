  // The mechanism is `icrc1_transfer` and nothing else. There is a second
  // *destination class*, so the phrase "one outflow" must not be read as "one kind of
  // recipient" — and the gate step greps declared METHODS, not destinations, so nothing
  // else would catch that drift:
  //
  //   1. **Delivery** — to a buyer's own account, for an order they paid for. Bounded by
  //      the order's `lockedCycles`, which the gate admitted against the floor, and by
  //      §2's own-destination rule: `create_order` refuses any destination but the
  //      caller's.
  //   2. **Withdrawal** — to a controller. Bounded by there being **no
  //      promise-holder at all**, so nothing is owed to any buyer, and it grants a
  //      controller no capability they lack: a controller can already move the reserve
  //      by upgrading this canister. `Main.withdraw_reserve` carries the full argument.
  //
  // Both decrement the floor by `amount + fee` before the transfer is issued (rule 2),
  // so the accounting below is identical for either class.
  //
  // **The enforcement is the actor type, not this comment.**
  // `Delivery.CyclesLedgerService` declares exactly `icrc1_transfer` and
  // `icrc1_balance_of`. `icrc2_approve` and the ledger's `withdraw` are absent, so this
  // canister *cannot* call them — not "does not plan to". A gate step greps the backend
  // for such declarations, so adding one has to be deliberate.
  //
  // ⚠️ **A grep finds `icrc1_transfer` at THREE call sites, and that is still one outflow
  // per execution.** Two of them are a delivery's attempt and its `#BadFee` re-issue of
  // the same intent; at most one can debit, and the ledger deduplicates if an earlier
  // attempt landed. Reading "two call sites" as "two outflows" and adding a second
  // decrement double-counts every delivery. The third is `withdraw_reserve`, a
  // separate execution entirely, which decrements once by the figure it debits.
