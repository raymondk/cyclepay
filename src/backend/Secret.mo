/// A stored Stripe secret (§7). **Two stores use this module**: the webhook signing
/// secret and the Checkout Sessions API key.
///
/// They share the rail's on/off switch: "live" means **both provisioned**, because
/// neither state can complete a purchase — no API key means no payable session, no
/// webhook secret means a buyer can pay and we cannot credit them.
///
/// ⚠️ **Stored plaintext in canister state, by design.** HMAC is symmetric, so
/// *verify = forge*: whoever reads the webhook blob can forge "paid" events, and
/// encrypting it would only move the problem to the key that decrypts it. The posture —
/// SEV-SNP as the confidentiality layer, the reserve balance as the always-on blast
/// radius, why a stock beats a per-period cap and the one way it does not — is
/// `docs/DESIGN.md` §7, with the confidential-subnet checklist in RUNBOOK.
///
/// ⚠️ **What a leak of each one buys an attacker differs, and that is why the key's SCOPE
/// matters more than its storage.** The webhook secret spends the reserve. A restricted
/// key scoped to Checkout Sessions = Write can only create sessions that pay **us**, and
/// read them back — which the recovery sweep needs. An unrestricted key, able to refund,
/// would be materially worse to leak.
