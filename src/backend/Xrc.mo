/// Exchange Rate Canister (XRC) binding — the ICP/USD half of §3 pricing.
///
/// The XRC is an NNS-governed protocol canister that queries multiple exchanges
/// and forex sources, aggregates them, and publishes the result with quality
/// metadata (`standard_deviation`, sources queried vs. answered). It refuses
/// with `InconsistentRatesReceived` rather than returning a number it doesn't
/// trust.
///
/// **This does not remove the off-chain dependency, it delegates it.** The XRC
/// makes HTTPS outcalls on our behalf — that is exactly what its fee encodes
/// (20 M cycles served from its cache, more when it has to fetch). What we gain
/// is that *this* canister makes no outcall: no `transform`, no
/// replica-divergence problem, no coarse rounding, no retry-for-boundary-split,
/// no IPv6 requirement, and no operator-settable source URL. And the aggregation
/// is done by something better at it than a single free endpoint, with a result
/// any third party can independently query and reproduce.
///
/// Call contract: **update call**, and exactly 1 B cycles must be attached.
/// Unused cycles are refunded; a minimum is charged even on error. The 1 B is a
/// *liquidity* requirement rather than a cost — the canister must be able to
/// attach it, so `Gate.Config.minCanisterCycles` has to stay comfortably above
/// it or pricing stops working (fail-closed, but the symptom looks like an
/// unexplained rate outage).
