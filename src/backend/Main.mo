  //    removes it there: the payment won, and `#cancelled` is unreachable from `#paid`,
  //    so nothing could honour the intent afterwards.

  // one of those — with no session id it takes the sessionless branch.
  //
  // **A stale entry could never mis-attribute even so**, because a delivered or paid

  // ⚠️ **Every `include` sits at the END of the actor body, and that is required rather
  // than tidy.** Its arguments are evaluated once, right here, so each must name a field

  // include placed where the endpoints used to be would capture bindings that do not
  // exist yet.
  //
  // ⚠️ **A `var` field is passed as an ACCESSOR PAIR, never as the field.** `include`
  // takes its arguments by value, so handing over `stripe.origin` would give the mixin a
  // snapshot from install time: the setter would mutate a copy and the getter would
  // answer that snapshot forever. Records and collections (`Secret.Store`,
  // `Orders.Store`, the maps and sets) are heap objects, so those pass directly and
  // write through.
  //
  // **Accessors rather than wrapping the `var` in a record**, which is the other fix
  // and the expensive one: wrapping changes the actor's stable shape, and with no
  // migration chain that means a reinstall. Closures are parameters, never stable
  // state, so `deployed/backend.most` does not move for this split.
