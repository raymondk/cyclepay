/// Hand-rolled HTTP ingress (§6.0).
///
/// ⚠️ **Not a rejected dependency — there is nothing to depend on.** Checked against the
/// pinned packages rather than assumed: `mo:core` contains no HTTP at all, and `mo:ic`'s
/// HTTP types are **outbound only** (`HttpRequestArgs` with `max_response_bytes`,
/// `transform`, `is_replicated` — the management canister's outcall interface, which
/// `rails/Session.mo` does use). Neither models the INBOUND gateway shape: `method`,
/// `url`, `headers`, `body` in; `status_code` and `upgrade` out. Those types have to be
/// declared here whichever way this goes.
///
/// So what is actually hand-rolled is the dispatch — about forty lines: a route table, a
/// per-route `upgrade` flag, a body-size guard, and two header helpers. The alternative
/// is a framework (`mo:server`), whose asset, caching and certification machinery this
/// canister does not use: assets live on a separate canister, and every response here is
/// either discarded pre-upgrade or an error, so nothing is certified. ⚠️ That comparison
/// is a judgement about a package this repo does not install and nothing here verifies —
/// the checkable half is the paragraph above.
///
/// Requests arrive as the *anonymous* principal (§6.0): routes here are
/// authenticated by payload only, never by caller. Dispatch is off a route
/// *table* with a per-route `upgrade` flag (binding seam §11.1.2) — "exactly
/// one route" is policy, not architecture; a future rail adds rows.
