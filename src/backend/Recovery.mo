  // `cancel_order`. If the expiry event never arrives, the promise holds capacity
  // against a session nobody can ever pay — and nothing sweeps `#created`, because
  // There is no retention sweep, deliberately. These predicates decide when to ask Stripe.

  /// How long past a session's own deadline to wait before asking Stripe about it.
  ///
  /// ⚠️ **This margin decides when to ASK, never what is TRUE.** A margin that decided the
  /// *outcome* was rejected: releasing capacity on our own copy of the deadline releases
  /// cycles a buyer may still be owed. Here the release comes from Stripe's answer either
  /// way, so being wrong costs a delayed release, never a wrong one.
  ///
  /// 30 min = two sweep intervals at the default cadence. Stripe fires the expiry event
