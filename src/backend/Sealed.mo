/// vetKD sealing: what turns a ciphertext an operator sent into the plaintext
/// secret `Secret.Store` holds.
///
/// The problem this solves is **provisioning exposure**, and only that. `set_stripe_api_key`
/// used to take the key as `text`, so the value crossed the TLS-terminating boundary node
/// in the clear — a shell history, a CI log and a boundary node all saw a live `rk_...`.
/// Now the operator encrypts to this canister's derived public key, computed offline, and
/// only this canister can open the result.
///
/// ⚠️ **At rest is NOT addressed here, deliberately.** The decrypted secret lives in
/// canister memory, replicated and checkpointed like any other state. That is irreducible:
/// HMAC verification needs the plaintext, so no scheme keeps it out of memory. Sealing works
/// this through and rejects the alternatives; the posture is `docs/DESIGN.md` §7, and the
/// confidentiality layer is the confidential subnet, not this module.
///
/// **What the unaudited dependency can and cannot cost us — `docs/DESIGN.md` §7.3.**
/// The encrypting is done client-side by `@icp-sdk/vetkeys`; this side only DECRYPTS. So a
/// bug here fails provisioning closed — the operator gets an error and no secret is stored
/// — rather than weakening a ciphertext that is already on the wire. That asymmetry is why
/// an experimental BLS12-381 is acceptable on this path and would not be on a path where a
/// bug could leak a plaintext.

// alternative is a hardcoded fee that goes stale silently — see `derivationFee` below.
