"""Fetch and write a GitHub issue body byte-exactly, verifying the round trip.

    scripts/issue-body.py get  <number> <file>     # fetch, verify length, write
    scripts/issue-body.py put  <number> <file>     # write back, then re-fetch and diff
    scripts/issue-body.py diff <number> <file>     # is the remote still what this file says?

⚠️ **Why this is a versioned script and not a snippet.**

Markdown built inside an *unquoted* heredoc lets the shell run the backticks in the text;
that has put a mangled 101k-char body live in place of a 53k one here. It was recoverable
only because a pre-edit fetch existed **with its length checked against the API's own
count** — which is what made the restore trustworthy rather than hopeful.

A tool that lives in a session scratchpad does not persist, so the next agent to touch a
large issue body has to re-derive it from prose. **A rule whose tool is gone is a rule
that gets skipped** — so the tool lives here, next to every other rule in this repo that
graduated from a comment into something executable (`check-heredocs.sh`,
`brand-lint.sh`, `test-all.sh`).

⚠️ **The abort is the feature.** Every failure mode here is silent: a truncated write
looks like a successful one, and a body that lost 40k characters still renders as a page
of Markdown. So each step compares against the API's own count and exits non-zero on any
mismatch rather than reporting what it hoped happened.

⚠️ **`put` verifies by re-fetching, not by trusting the write.** GitHub accepting the
request is not evidence the stored body matches the file — the corruption above was
accepted cleanly. Only a read-back proves it.

Requires `gh` (authenticated). `GH_REPO`, or `--repo owner/name`, overrides the default.
