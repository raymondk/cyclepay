# Deploy-and-wiring smoke test against a real local network.
#
# Why this exists: the PocketIC suite installs wasms directly and never runs
# `icp deploy`, so four things it covers perfectly well in-canister have **no
# automated coverage at all** at the deployment layer:
#
#   1. the deploy itself — recipe pipeline, `shrink: true`, the embedded
#      candid:service metadata, the Candid compatibility check;
#   2. the `PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:xrc` override branch — in PocketIC the mock sits
#      *at* the mainnet id, so no env var is injected and only the fallback
#      branch ever runs. The override executes solely on a local network;
#   3. the asset canister and its `ic_env` cookie — the frontend serving at all;
#   4. `icp.yaml` environment scoping, i.e. that the `ic` environment excludes
#      the local-only `xrc` mock so it can never reach mainnet.
#
# None of these is a canister behaviour, which is exactly why the canister test
# suite misses them. A broken `icp.yaml` or a bad recipe pin would ship silently.
#
# Deliberately NOT covered: the money path. Reaching `delivered` locally needs the
# CMC rate set by impersonating governance through the PocketIC control API, which
# is not a supported `icp` interface — the port is unpublished and may change
# between releases. `scripts/local-dev-seed.sh` does exactly that when you want to
# click through the app by hand; this smoke test stays independent of it so it
# keeps working if the port moves. Every money-path assertion lives in the
# PocketIC suite, where it needs none of this.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/e2e-local.sh              # start a network if needed, deploy, assert, tear down
#   scripts/e2e-local.sh --keep       # leave the network running afterwards
#   scripts/e2e-local.sh --no-deploy  # assert against what is already deployed
#
# A network this script did not start is never stopped, --keep or not.
#
# Prerequisites: icp-cli ≥ 1.2.0, jq, node, python3, curl.
