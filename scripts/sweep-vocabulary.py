"""Scan the lines a change ADDS for vocabulary that names a deleted mechanism.

    scripts/sweep-vocabulary.py --base <ref>     # against an explicit base

⚠️ **Scoped to the diff, and it keeps no counts.** A recorded population is a measurement,
and a measurement expires: it cannot tell "removed two legitimate uses, added one stale
claim" from "removed one", so a prose-purging change that also introduces a stale claim
nets downward and reads clean. That is a check whose negative result is indistinguishable
from a passing one — the class this whole artifact exists to catch. Added lines have no
such hole: a stale claim is a stale claim whatever else the change did.

⚠️ **It also removes the corpus question.** A count needs a population to count, so it
needs globs, and globs go stale silently — the version that kept counts covered 40 files
and missed `test/`, `src/backend/rails/` and `scripts/` entirely, which is where two stale
claims were added and reviewed past it. A diff has no population to enumerate: every added
line in the tree is in scope, wherever it lives.

⚠️ **It PRINTS; it does not fail on a hit.** Most hits are correct prose — this repo has
~20 lines that correctly say a removed mechanism is gone — and a check that fires on
correct code teaches people to route around it. Adjudication is a judgement call, and a
judgement call can only be surfaced. The one failure is an **undeterminable base ref**,
because that is the didn't-run case, which this project treats as failure everywhere.

⚠️ **An empty diff is a genuine pass, not an abort.** Other steps abort when they find
nothing to check, because for them empty input means the step is aimed at nothing. Here it
means the change added no lines, which is a real and correct answer.

The term list and its dispositions are read FROM `docs/agents/deleted-vocabulary.md`, so
there is one list, not two.
