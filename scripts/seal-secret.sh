# Provision a Stripe secret into the backend, sealed with vetKD.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/seal-secret.sh api-key         [environment]   # reads STRIPE_API_KEY
#   scripts/seal-secret.sh webhook-secret  [environment]   # reads STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
#
# `environment` is an icp-cli environment name and defaults to `local`. Pass `ic` for
# mainnet.
#
# ⚠️ **THE MASTER KEY IS DERIVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, NEVER TYPED.**
#
# Mainnet and a local network both have a vetKD key called `key_1`, backed by different
# master keys — necessarily, since a local network cannot hold mainnet's master secret. So
# the key *name* does not identify the key, and sealing against the wrong one produces a
# ciphertext **nobody can ever open**, with nothing to notice until the canister tries.
#
# That is why this mapping lives in code rather than in a flag a human passes:
#
#     environment `ic`  ->  mainnet  master key
#     anything else     ->  pocketic master key   (a managed local network IS PocketIC)
#
# The sealer refuses to default `--source`, so if this script ever stops passing it the
# result is an error rather than a wrong guess.
#
# ⚠️ **The secret is read from the environment, never from an argument.** A value on the
# command line lands in shell history and in CI logs — the very exposure sealing exists to
# close. Closing it in transit while opening it in `~/.zsh_history` would be theatre.
