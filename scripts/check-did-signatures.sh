# Assert the canister's Candid SIGNATURES are unchanged against a git ref, ignoring doc
# comments.
#
# **Why signatures rather than the whole file.** A pure relocation of endpoints must
# not move the interface, and `git diff` on `backend.did` is the natural proof — until doc
# text moves independently of the API, at which point a byte diff can no longer tell "I
# relocated code" from "I changed the contract".
#
# moc 1.16.0 emits doc comments for mixin members, so a relocation carries its doc along
# and leaves the `.did` doc lines untouched. What moves independently is an ordinary doc
# EDIT: it is published, so it shows up in the interface diff beside real signature
# changes, which is the confusion this separates.
#
# So this strips `///` lines from both sides and compares what is left: method names,
# argument names and types, return types, and every type declaration. That is the part a
# caller is bound by.
#
# ⚠️ **Not a gate step, and it could not be one:** it compares against a ref you choose,
# which only the author of a refactor knows. Run it while relocating code, and quote the
# result in the PR — the way `check-stable-promotion.sh` is run at promotion time.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-did-signatures.sh [git-ref]     (default: merge-base with main)
