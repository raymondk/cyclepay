"""Fail if two module functions have the same body.

⚠️ **The class: one piece of arithmetic implemented twice, in two modules, both live.**
Nothing else here can see it. `check-unused-motoko.py` finds a function with no caller;
this finds two functions that both have callers and both do the same thing — where the
loss is not dead code but **divergence**, because the next correction lands on one of them.

**The motivating class, on the money path:** a private `Reserve.deliverable`
re-implementing `Delivery.deliverableCycles` — the fee-on-top correction — while claiming
*"the same correction, so the same function"* and taking over a call site from the real
one. Delivery and withdrawal are the two outflow classes of one account, so a fee
correction diverging between them is exactly the failure `Reserve.mo`'s "two destination
classes, ONE outflow mechanism" framing exists to prevent. ⚠️ **A naive implementation
does not catch it**, for two reasons recorded on `MIN_TOKENS` and on the normalisation
steps -- each of those notes is a claim measurement contradicted, so do not relax one
without re-measuring.

**Normalisation:** comments stripped (block comments NEST), parameters renamed
positionally, in-expression type annotations dropped, whitespace collapsed. The last two
exist because the motivating case needed them — see the notes at the code.

⚠️ **`MIN_TOKENS` is a small floor, not a filter, and the measurement is on the constant
itself.** This tree has zero cross-module duplicate bodies at every threshold from 4 up,
so the bar excludes nothing today; it exists so a future pair of one-expression
projections cannot report as duplication. The count below the bar is printed so the
exemption stays visible rather than implied.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach**, stated because a check implying more than it verifies is
worse than no check:

  - **Near-duplicates.** Two bodies that differ by a LOCAL variable name, an argument
    order, or a `+ 1` are distinct here. Parameter names and in-expression type
    annotations ARE normalised — both were needed to see the motivating case — but
    anything beyond that needs a parser, and a similarity score would need tuning against
    false positives on every commit.
  - **Duplication across a module and a mixin, or inside one function.** Only
    `public func` bodies in `src/backend/**/*.mo` are compared, and only against each
    other.
  - **Whether the duplicate is the WRONG one.** It reports the pair; a human decides
    which call site should survive.
