"""Fail if a public endpoint has no documentation.

⚠️ **Why this is a gate step, and why it is phrased as the VICTIM rather than the
defect.** A `///` block sits above a declaration; insert or move a declaration between
them and the block silently attaches to the wrong one. In Motoko that reaches the
canister's published interface — the doc lands on the wrong method in `backend.did`, so
the interface documents the wrong contract.

This class produced **five** separate instances in this repo before anything checked it:
`cancel_order`'s contract published on `expire_order`; `feeBreakdown`'s doc over
`feeRows`; `estimateLine`'s over `creditedSplit`; a direction warning stranded above a
function that computes no direction; and `refusal_counts` plus `orphan_depth` both glued
above `admin_order`, which the interface therefore documented with three unrelated
contracts. Every one was found by a human reading.

⚠️ **The orphan cannot be detected; the victim can.** Adjacent `///` lines are
indistinguishable from one multi-paragraph doc, so a text heuristic over doc blocks is
hopeless — the one written for this produced 70 candidates, of which 1 was real. But a
declaration whose doc was absorbed by a neighbour has **none of its own**, which is a
fixed syntactic target and therefore gate-able.

⚠️ **Two checks over two oracles, and neither subsumes the other.**

  1. `undocumented()` reads the SOURCE and asks "does every endpoint have a doc". The
     first version asked this of `backend.did`, the tidier oracle — until endpoints moved
     into `mixin` blocks and moc dropped every one of their docs from the
     interface, so the `.did` could no longer answer it. The source always could.
  2. `misattributed()` reads BOTH and asks "is the doc the interface publishes the one
     written above that endpoint". Only the `.did` can answer this, because the class it
     catches is invisible in source by construction.

⚠️ **moc 1.16.0 emits mixin members' docs, which is why (2) has this shape.** Measured on
this project: 0 doc lines inside the `service` block on 1.15.1, **613 on 1.16.0**, with
all 62 endpoints' published blocks byte-equal to their source blocks. The previous version
of (2) asserted the `.did` documented *no* endpoint — sound only while the docs were being
dropped — and its remedy said *make it `//` instead of `///`*, which under 1.16.0 would
delete a deliberately published doc. Comparing the two texts replaces an absence
assertion with a direct one.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach**, stated because a check implying more than it verifies is
worse than no check:

  - **Whether a doc describes the declaration it sits on.** A method documented with the
    WRONG contract passes: it has a doc. This catches the victim, never the thief — so it
    makes the class *detectable*, not impossible. Two glued blocks over one undocumented
    neighbour is the shape it sees.
  - **A doc absorbed onto an endpoint from a NON-endpoint neighbour.** Invisible in
    source by construction: the block sits correctly above the state declaration that
    owns it, and the endpoint has its own `///`, so thief and victim both read clean.
    Only the `.did` shows it — `webhookSecret`'s doc published on `get_order`, the price
    tiles' on `resolve_problem` — so `misattributed()` below covers this one from the
    `.did` side, which is the only side that can see it.
  - **Types, fields, and private helpers.** Only `public shared` / `public query`
    endpoints are checked.
  - **Doc quality.** A single `///` line satisfies it.

    ⚠️ **This replaced a check asserting the `.did` documented NO endpoint.** That

    members, and every endpoint is in a mixin — so any doc that appeared in the service
    block had floated there off a private declaration. **moc 1.16.0 emits mixin members'
    docs**, measured at 0 -> 613 doc lines inside this project's service block, so the old
    premise is gone and its remedy (*make it `//`*) would now delete a correct doc.

    The class it existed for survives, and this is the direct form of it: a doc absorbed
    onto an endpoint during EMISSION is invisible in the source — the block sits correctly
    above the declaration that owns it — and shows up only as a `.did` that publishes
    something other than what was written. Comparing the two catches it by construction,
    rather than by asserting the absence of all docs.

    ⚠️ **What this does NOT catch, and `undocumented()` does.** A SOURCE-level theft — a
    declaration moved in between a `///` block and its function — relocates the doc to the
    neighbour, and moc then publishes it there. `.did` and source agree, so this function
    is silent; the tell is the victim, which loses its doc entirely. The two checks are
    complementary and neither subsumes the other.
