"""Fail if a public endpoint returns `Result<_, Text>`.

An untyped error forces every caller to match on prose to tell one failure from another
(`reviewing-motoko` T4). No endpoint returns one today, and this is what keeps it that
way.

⚠️ **Enforced rather than achieved, because achieved uniformity decays.** Three surfaces
in this repo reached "complete" and then regressed while nothing was watching — the admin
command table, the doc-surface list, and the gate/CI script pair. A rule with no check is
a rule the next endpoint walks past.

Reads the generated `backend.did`, not the source: that is where a caller sees the error,
and it is the artifact the frontend's bindings come from.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach:**

  - **A variant with a `Text` payload.** `#stripeFailed : { detail : Text }` is fine and
    stays fine — Stripe's own wording is a string an external system owns, which is the
    case T1 leaves alone. Only `Result`'s whole error position is checked.
  - **`Text` in an OK position.** A method returning text is not an error contract.
  - **Whether a variant's arms are well chosen.** It sees that the error is typed, never
    that the types are right.
