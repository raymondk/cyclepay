# The pinned BLS12-381 and vetKD packages match the Rust reference, under OUR toolchain.
#
# `src/backend/Sealed.mo` decrypts the Stripe secrets with an EXPERIMENTAL, UNAUDITED
# BLS12-381 port, pinned as a git submodule at `vendor/icp-seeding-secrets-poc`, because
# `mo:ic-vetkeys` has no curve. Its vectors were generated from `ic_bls12_381` and
# `ic-vetkeys` — DFINITY's Rust implementations, themselves unaudited — so what they
# assert is not this port's arithmetic restated but values an independent implementation
# produced.
#
# **Why run them here when the source repository already does.** Two reasons, and the
# second is the one that matters:
#
#   1. `mops test` does not descend into path dependencies, so these suites execute in
#      this project only if something runs them explicitly. Nothing else does.
#   2. The upstream run proves the vectors under **that repository's** toolchain pins, not
#      ours. **They HAVE now diverged** — upstream is pinned to moc 1.15.1 and this
#      project moved to 1.16.0 — which is why the run below rewrites the pin instead of
#      testing in place. Upstream pins its own compiler and this project's moves
#      independently, so the combination actually shipped here is tested nowhere else.
#
# It is also what makes a submodule work at all: `mops` cannot address a package inside a
# repository subdirectory — measured, it silently DISCARDS the subdirectory and installs
# the repository root, which has no `src/`. Having the packages on disk is what lets their
# suites run in the same gate that guards the key they protect.
#
# ⚠️ **DO NOT SKIP OR DELETE THIS STEP TO GET A BUILD GREEN.** `docs/DESIGN.md` §7.3
# accepts an unaudited BLS12-381 on the money path, and that acceptance is conditional on
# this check running — not on the argument in the prose. A `moc` upgrade that makes the
# pinned packages fail to compile is the likely trigger: skipping their suites to move on
# quietly removes the only thing standing behind that decision, and nothing else reports it.
# Fix the compile, bump the pin, or reopen §7.3 — do not silence this.
#
# ⚠️ **What this does NOT establish.** These suites prove the port agrees with the
# reference on the vectors it ships. They are not an audit, they do not cover inputs the
# generator never produced, and passing here is not a statement that the implementation is
# constant-time or side-channel free. `docs/DESIGN.md` §7.3 carries the argument for why
# that is acceptable on THIS path — the client-side `@icp-sdk/vetkeys` does the encrypting, so
# a bug here fails provisioning closed rather than weakening a ciphertext in flight.

# compiler while the backend compiles the same source under ours — so the moment the two
# diverge, this check silently stops covering the combination that ships, which is exactly
# the gap §7.3's acceptance depends on not existing. It went unnoticed for one commit
# during the 1.16.0 bump.
#
# `mops` has no flag or environment override for the compiler (`mops test --help`), so the
# suites run from a temp root with the pin rewritten to ours — see the symlink note below
# for how. The rewrite is VERIFIED rather than assumed: a `sed` that silently matched
# nothing would put us straight back to testing the wrong compiler.

# materialised — `src/`, `test/`, `bench/` and the vectors are linked, and the submodule's

# submodule's own `mops.toml` in place mutates checked-out state and leaves it dirty if a
# run is interrupted, and duplicating the suites into `test/` would be a real, maintained
# copy of someone else's tests.
#
# ⚠️ **Both packages must be SIBLINGS in one root.** `vetkeys` declares

# per-package root gives `package error [M0012], file "../bls12-381" does not exist`, and
