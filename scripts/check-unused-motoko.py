"""Fail if a module's `public func` has no caller outside its own tests.

The Motoko half of `check-unused-exports.py`, which gates this class for the frontend
only. ⚠️ **The class, with a measured instance:** `Gate.configErrorToText`'s only caller
was `test/gate.test.mo` — *a `*ToText` with no production caller is dead code that reads
as a supported path* — and nothing flagged it.

⚠️ **The compiler contributes nothing here, which is why this has to exist.** moc's
unused-identifier warning (M0194) fires only in the canister's MAIN file — never in
modules or mixins. So an entire module of dead exports compiles clean under `-Werror`.

⚠️ **Comments are stripped before the reference scan, and that is load-bearing.** The
frontend checker learned it the hard way: it decided `in_prod` over raw text, so any
comment naming a symbol shielded it — and this codebase comments heavily. A symbol whose
only "caller" is prose about it is dead. The stripper here is Motoko's, not TypeScript's:
Motoko has no template literals, and its block comments NEST (`/* /* */ */` is one
comment), which a non-counting stripper closes too early and then eats live code.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach**, stated because a check implying more than it verifies is
worse than no check:

  - **`public type`, `public let`, `public class`.** Functions only. A dead type is
    harmless in a way a dead function is not: it cannot be mistaken for a supported
    operation, and types are legitimately referenced only in signatures.
  - **Mixins and the composition root.** A mixin's `public shared` functions are
    endpoints, reached by the IC and gated by `check-endpoint-docs.py` instead.
  - **A function reachable only through dead code.** This is a reference scan, not a
    call graph: `a` calling `b` keeps `b` alive even when nothing calls `a`. Deleting a
    dead function can therefore reveal the next one; run this again after deleting.
  - **Whether a used function is used WELL.** One caller in one branch counts.

An export that legitimately has no production caller — a test oracle derived from a type
— gets an in-source `@test-oracle` marker in the doc block directly above it, and the
count is printed. A list of exemptions inside this script is where an exemption goes to
be forgotten.
