"""Fail if `Main.mo` uses `///` anywhere but its leading block.

⚠️ **A `///` on a declaration candid does not emit cannot land anywhere legitimate — it
is either dropped or LEAKED onto an unrelated endpoint.** That is not a style rule, it is
the whole failure mode: moc assigns doc comments to emitted declarations by position, and
the composition root emits nothing except the service itself (A1 — no public methods
here). So a doc block on a state `let`, a private helper, or a `transient var` has no
destination, and the compiler gives it the nearest one it can find.

**Four live instances existed before this check.** `webhookSecret`'s doc was published on
`get_order`, the price tiles' on `resolve_problem`, `rateRefreshFailures`' on
`set_recovery_interval`, and `allowedBuyers`' on `withdraw_reserve` — so the interface
told a reader that `get_order` was the Stripe webhook signing key. It reached the
generated TypeScript too, which is what shows on hover in an editor.

⚠️ **`check-endpoint-docs.py`'s `leaked_docs()` detects the same class from the `.did`,
and this check exists because detecting it is the wrong end.** The leak is POSITIONAL:
measured, inserting a single declaration into `Main.mo` shifts two FURTHER endpoints into
leaking, from private-state docs unrelated to them. So the
detector fires on edits that did not cause it, with "find the block whose text matches"
as the recurring fix. Refusing the input at the source means the diagnostic names the
line responsible and needs no rebuild to fire. `leaked_docs()` stays as the backstop for
whatever this cannot see.

**The one legitimate `///`: the file's leading block.** moc emits it as the service
documentation — verified in `backend.did`, where it sits directly above `service : {`,
not at the top of the file. In the source it sits above the first `import` rather than
above `persistent actor`, which is why this check is positional rather than looking for
the actor line. ⚠️ That placement is what `published_docs()`'s `service + 1` accounts for:
the emitted doc is permanently the line before the service line.

⚠️ **This ban is now BELT with little left to brace, and it is kept by choice.**
It exists because a `///` on a private state declaration can alias onto an unrelated
endpoint — four live instances once, fixed in a128982.

**Measured against a128982^, the commit that still had all four**, building the identical
source under both compilers:

| endpoint | 1.15.1 published | 1.16.0 published |
|---|---|---|
| `get_order` | the webhook secret's §7 doc | its own §2 authz doc |
| `resolve_problem` | "The price tiles, as one record." | its own §4.1/§7 doc |
| `set_recovery_interval` | `rateRefreshFailures`' backoff doc | its own cadence doc |
| `withdraw_reserve` | `allowedBuyers`' doc | its own doc |

28 service-block doc lines with all four stolen, versus 600 with none. **So aliasing was a
symptom of the drop** — a neighbour's doc filled an empty slot, and 1.16.0 leaves no empty
slots. Strong evidence rather than proof: four known positions, not all positions.

⚠️ **An earlier version of this block claimed the question "was not measured".** That came
from probing with the wrong instrument — a marker doc on a private `var`, which leaked
under neither compiler and so proved nothing either way. The reproducer was the four known
positions all along.

The ban therefore prevents a class that appears fixed, while
`check-endpoint-docs.py`'s `misattributed()` would *catch* it if it recurred. It is kept
because the evidence is strong rather than exhaustive, and its only cost is LSP hover on
742 actor-private blocks — worth revisiting as its own change, not as a rider on a
compiler bump.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach**, stated because a check implying more than it verifies is
worse than no check:

  - **Any other file.** Modules and mixins are unaffected: a `///` on a module's `public
    func` is the right convention, and since moc 1.16.0 a mixin member's doc is PUBLISHED
    on its own endpoint — which is the point of writing it. Only the composition root has
    a service to leak ONTO.
  - **Whether the comment is any good.** `//` and `///` are equally unpublished here, so
    this is purely about where moc may send the text.
  - ⚠️ **The cost this does impose, stated rather than waved away.** `///` is what a
    Motoko LSP surfaces on hover, and `//` is not — so the 742 converted blocks lose
    hover, and only that. Nothing *publishes* them (no `mo-doc` or `mops docs` here, and
    `backend.did` never carried the text), and they document actor-private declarations,
    so anyone reading them is already in the file. If moc stops aliasing docs onto
    unrelated endpoints, converting back is one `sed` — which is how this direction was
    proven in the first place.
