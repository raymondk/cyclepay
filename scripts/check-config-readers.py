"""Every configuration SETTER must have a reader, so no parameter is write-only.

    scripts/check-config-readers.py

⚠️ **Found by a UI spec, not by any check.** `set_delivery_config` could set `maxHoldNs`
(when a paid order escalates) and `alertAfterNs` (the delay-alert threshold), and **no
method returned either** — they appeared in the setter's argument and its error variant and
nowhere else. An operator could set the two bounds that decide when a stuck delivery
surfaces and never read them back. That went unnoticed through five PRs touching this
surface, because nothing was looking.

⚠️ **A setter missing from `READERS` is a FAILURE, not a skip.** That is the whole
mechanism: a new `set_*` method has to be classified deliberately, so the next write-only
parameter fails here instead of being discovered by a UI three months later.

The requirement is derived, not declared, wherever it can be: if a setter takes a single
NAMED type, the mapped reader must return that same type — so a config record gaining a
field is covered automatically. Where the argument is a primitive there is no type to
trace, and the entry names the field or settles for the reader existing.
