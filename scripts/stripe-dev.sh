# Local Stripe-sandbox loop against a local `icp network`.
#
# Wires the Stripe CLI's webhook forwarder to a locally deployed backend so the
# real §6.1 path runs end to end: genuine Stripe signatures, genuine event JSON,
# genuine retry behaviour on a non-2xx.
#
# ## Run scripts/local-dev-seed.sh FIRST
#
# The two scripts own different levers and this one assumes the other has run:
#
#   local-dev-seed.sh  the money levers — tiers, the cycles reserve, the CMC rate,
#                      the canister's own cycles
#   this script        the Stripe levers — expected livemode, the forwarding
#                      session's signing secret, forwarding
#
# ⚠️ **Neither script touches the other's levers, and that is not tidiness.** When both
# set tiers, the ORDER of the two silently decided the outcome — whichever ran last
# overwrote the other's with a placeholder, with nothing to see afterwards. This script
# refuses to start if the gateway cannot price, which is how it says "run the seed
# first" instead of quietly half-configuring.
#
# `npm --prefix test/integration run sandbox` is the scripted alternative when you do
# not need the frontend in a browser — it boots its own PocketIC and needs none of
# this.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/stripe-dev.sh              # bootstrap Stripe config, wire the secret, forward
#   scripts/stripe-dev.sh --no-bootstrap   # only wire the secret and forward
#   scripts/stripe-dev.sh --print-only     # print the forward URL and exit
#
# Prerequisites:
#   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
#   stripe login          # choose a SANDBOX account, never a live one
#   icp network start -d && icp deploy && scripts/local-dev-seed.sh

cat <<'NOTES'
      Builds a SYNTHETIC session with no client_reference_id, so it lands as a
      Type 1 #unattributed entry. That is a real test of the attribution guard,
      not the happy path.

  For the happy path, buy through the UI at the URL `icp deploy` printed for the
  frontend, which is the whole point of running against a local network. The
  browser path and the CLI path below produce the same order.

  Or from the CLI:
      1. icp canister call backend create_order \
             '(variant { tier = "t10" }, variant { cyclesLedgerAccount = record {
                  owner = principal "<your-principal>"; subaccount = null } }, null)'
         The account must be the caller's own, default subaccount — anything else
         is refused with #destinationNotOwned. Get yours with
         `icp identity principal`, and pass the same --identity to the call.
         (the third argument pins a minimum cycle quantity; null opts out)
      2. Take stripeSessionUrl from the returned order and open it. That IS the
         payment page: the canister created a Checkout Session per order and set
         client_reference_id through the API, so there is no link to configure and
         no URL parameter to append.
      3. Pay with test card 4242 4242 4242 4242.

         ⚠ The session expires 35 minutes after creation, enforced by Stripe.
         ⚠ After paying, Stripe redirects to the origin the seed configured
           (https://<frontend-id>.icp.net), which does NOT serve your local
           frontend. The payment still completes and the webhook still fires —
           the landing page is the only thing that will not load. Watch the order
           through `get_order` or the local UI instead.

  Inspect what happened:
      icp canister call backend audit_log_recent '(null, 25 : nat)'
      icp canister call backend orphans_unresolved '(null, 50)'
      icp canister call backend order_for_payment '("pi_...")'

Two things to expect locally:

1. Signature timestamps are checked against the replica's OWN clock with a ±300 s
   tolerance. If local time has drifted further than that from real time, every
   live webhook is rejected with a 400.

2. **The CMC rate expires 15 minutes after the seed script set it**, and pricing
   then refuses every new order. It does not affect an order that already exists:
   the rate is locked at creation. Refresh with:
       scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only
