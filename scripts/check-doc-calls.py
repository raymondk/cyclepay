"""Every `icp canister call backend <method> '(...)'` in docs and scripts must
actually run: the method has to exist in the committed `.did`, and the number of
top-level arguments has to match what it declares.

Why this exists: a method's arity changes and the prose calling it does not.
`audit_log` gaining `(opt nat, nat)` while three places still call it `'()'`, or
`quote_previews` losing an argument a runbook line keeps passing, are both an
operator's copy-paste failing mid-incident and neither is visible to any suite:
these are strings in prose, so nothing type-checks them and the gate was green.

`check-admin-commands.py` is the neighbouring check and does NOT cover this. It
compares mutating methods against the console's command table; arity in prose is
a different question about different files.

Scope, deliberately: arity is checked only where the argument is a LITERAL. A
templated one (`<candid args>`, `$VAR`, `%s`) has its method checked and its
arity skipped, because the text is a shape rather than a call.

Known limits, accepted rather than overlooked:

- **Arity, not types.** `orphans '("x", "y")'` passes: two arguments is what the
  method takes. Checking types needs a real candid parser and a type
  environment; arity is a small scanner that catches all four historical
  instances in this repo, both of the live ones included.
- **A templated argument is not checked at all**, only its method name.
- **The console's printed commands are not read from here.** They come from a
  typed table in `src/frontend/src/candid.ts`, and `candid.test.ts` asserts their
  arity against the generated `idlFactory`. Both halves are needed: the type
  binds each renderer's SIGNATURE, not the string it returns, so a renderer that
  accepts two arguments and emits one type-checks clean.
