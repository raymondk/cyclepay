# The committed Candid bindings match the canister's own interface.
#
# **Why the bindings are committed rather than generated on demand.** The integration
# CI job installs only `test/integration` deps and never runs `mops build` — so it
# typechecks against whatever is in the checkout. Generating at test time would need the
# Motoko toolchain in that job; committing means a fresh checkout can typecheck and run,
# and an interface change shows up in a pull-request diff instead of only at runtime.
#
# **The cost of committing generated code is that it rots silently, which is what this
# check exists for.** Same pattern the gate already applies one layer down to
# `src/backend/dist/backend.did` — regenerate, diff, fail on drift.
#
# **Why generated at all.** Hand-transcribing `test/integration/src/idl.ts` is 555
# lines of `IDL.Func` declarations, and `types.ts` 42 TypeScript mirrors, with nothing
# checking either against the Motoko. Such a copy drifts in both directions at once: a
# `GateReason` mirror keeps variants the backend deleted and misses ones it added, so
# those refusals are undecodable from the suite and therefore untestable.
#
# ⚠️ **And a mirror fails ASYMMETRICALLY, which is why no test caught it.** Declaring a
# field the canister lacks breaks the Candid decode and gets found. *Omitting* one decodes
# fine and the suite silently covers less than it claims.
