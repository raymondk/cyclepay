"""Assert the docs' method lists match the canister's ACTUAL public surface.

⚠️ **Why this is a gate step and not a review habit.** A table introduced with "this is
the whole admin surface" drifts as methods land: one in `docs/STRIPE.md` was missing
**11 of 29** admin methods, including the two secret-status queries `RUNBOOK.md` tells an
operator to call to confirm a rotation — while `RUNBOOK.md` named `webhook_status`, which
has never existed. The method is `webhook_secret_status`.

Neither failure is visible by reading either document: a list of plausible method names
reads as complete, and a name that does not exist reads exactly like one that does. The
only thing that can tell them apart is the interface itself, so the check is mechanical.

**Authority is the committed `.did`** (regenerated and diff-checked one step earlier in
`test-all.sh`, so by the time this runs it is known current) for *what exists*, and
`Main.mo`'s guards for *who may call it*.

Two things are deliberately NOT enforced, because enforcing them would make the check
a nuisance rather than a tripwire:

  - **Prose descriptions.** Only names are compared. A stale *description* is a real
    problem — `recount_orders` described as "rebuild… from the store" after it became
    bounded — but it is not mechanically checkable, and a check that cannot see it must
    not imply it can.
  - **Every mention.** Only the explicitly-marked list blocks are compared. A method
    named in passing mid-paragraph is prose.

Marked blocks are delimited in the Markdown by HTML comments, so the checker never has
to guess where a list starts:

    <!-- surface:admin -->      ... <!-- /surface -->
    <!-- surface:public -->     ... <!-- /surface -->
    <!-- surface:owner -->      ... <!-- /surface -->

Within a block, every `` `identifier` `` is taken as a claimed member. `surface:public`
blocks may omit the HTTP-gateway plumbing (`http_request`, `http_request_update`,
`transform_stripe_response`) and `create_order`, which are public but are not
*monitoring* queries — that allowance is listed explicitly below rather than inferred,
so adding a method never silently lands in it.
