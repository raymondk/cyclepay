# Fail on an UNQUOTED heredoc whose body contains a command substitution.
#
# **Two substrates, both live in this repo.** Markdown for a GitHub issue body inside
# `<<PY` lets the shell execute the backticks in the text — that has put a mangled
# 101k-char body live in place of 53k. And unquoting a `<<NOTES` block so that one
# variable interpolates activates every `…` span in it, `icp deploy` included, so
# printing a script's closing notes RUNS a deploy.
#
# Written down as a rule it did not hold: the second instance arrived in the fix for a
# review finding whose subject was that written-down lessons do not transfer. Hence a
# check rather than a rule.
#
# **This belongs in the gate rather than the Traps section because its target is FIXED
# syntax**, unlike a vocabulary sweep whose target moves with every issue — the same test
# the outflow census passes. A fixed target can be enforced; a judgement call can only be
# surfaced.
#
# ⚠️ **What it does NOT catch — and the bigger gap is the first incident above.** That one
# was an ad-hoc heredoc typed into a command that never became a file, so nothing scanning
# `git ls-files` can ever see it. This gate covers heredocs **in committed scripts** only;
# one typed at a prompt still has to be quoted by hand, and still has to be remembered.
#
# ⚠️ Also not caught, and it is a REAL hazard rather than an oversight: a dollar amount in
# an unquoted body. `$100 ceiling` expands to `00 ceiling` — silently, with no error, in a
# repo whose operator prose is full of prices. It is excluded because unquoted heredocs are
# also used legitimately to interpolate (`local-dev-seed.sh` prints a gateway port that
# way), so flagging every dollar sign would fire on correct code. If a dollar amount ever
# needs to appear in an unquoted body, escape it `\$100` or move the line out.
#
# Also not caught: a body that is clean today and gains a backtick later — caught on *that*
# change rather than this one, which is why it runs every time.

✗ an unquoted heredoc contains a command substitution — the shell will RUN it.

  Quote the tag (<<'TAG') so the body is literal text. If one line genuinely needs a
  variable, keep the heredoc quoted and print that line separately — escaping the
  backticks works today and re-breaks the next time someone writes prose with one.
