# Make a local network's gateway actually usable: rate, tiers, delivery timeline,
# and a funded cycles reserve.
#
# A freshly deployed gateway is **fail-closed by design** — no tiers, an empty
# cycles reserve, and (locally) no exchange rate. That is correct for production and
# indistinguishable from "broken" when you are trying to click through the app,
# where it shows as "No amounts are configured yet" and "No exchange rate
# available yet".
#
# ## The part that is not obvious: the CMC rate
#
# Pricing needs BOTH rates. The XRC comes from the local mock (icp.yaml), but the
# CMC's conversion rate is only settable by NNS **governance**, and no local
# identity is governance. Docs in this repo previously called that a hard local
# blocker.
#
# It is not: a local `icp network` IS a PocketIC instance, and PocketIC's control
# API — on a second port of the same process — can submit an ingress message from
# an arbitrary sender. That is what this script does.
#
# ⚠️ That control port is **not a supported `icp` interface.** It is unpublished
# and may move or disappear between icp-cli releases. This script discovers it
# from the running process rather than assuming, and fails with an explanation
# rather than a stack trace. Nothing in CI or the test gate depends on it; the
# PocketIC suite drives its own instance through the supported pic-js API.
#
# ## The rate goes stale after 15 minutes
#
# `Cmc.cmcRateMaxAgeNs` is a security control, not a tuning knob. Re-run this
# script (or just `--rate-only`) whenever the app starts refusing orders again.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/local-dev-seed.sh              # everything
#   scripts/local-dev-seed.sh --rate-only  # just refresh the CMC rate

  What works now, and what needs Stripe:
    - Browsing amounts, signing in, creating an order, cancelling: all work
      — but CREATING an order needs your principal on the buyer allow-list
      first. Sign in, copy the principal, then:
        icp canister call backend add_allowed_buyer '(principal "<yours>")'
      Or re-run this script with BUYER_PRINCIPAL=<principal>. Without it the
      gateway refuses every buyer with unboundedGiveaway, because a funded
      reserve plus free Stripe test payments plus an empty list is a faucet.
    - PAYING needs BOTH Stripe secrets. There are no Payment Links any more:
      the canister creates a Checkout Session per order and sets
      client_reference_id on it through the API, so nothing has to be
      configured in the Dashboard.

        1. A restricted API key (rk_...) with Checkout Sessions = Write (which
           includes the read the recovery sweep needs) and everything else None.
           Put it in scripts/.local-dev.env (gitignored, sourced by this script)
           rather than on a command line, then re-run.
        2. A signed webhook to deliver: scripts/stripe-dev.sh starts the
           forwarder and provisions the signing secret from that session.

      Check both with stripe_api_key_status and webhook_secret_status.

  One thing in a paying run that looks like a bug and is not:
    - The session expires 35 minutes after creation, enforced by Stripe. The
      pay button disappears at the deadline, and it goes before the
      checkout.session.expired webhook lands, because the UI renders expiry
      from expiresAtNs rather than from the status.

  ⚠️ The CMC rate goes stale in 15 minutes. Re-run with --rate-only.
