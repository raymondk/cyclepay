"""Assert every `§N` label in the code is glossed, every glossed row is used, and every
pointer the glossary gives still resolves.

⚠️ **Why this is a gate step and not a convention.** The `§N` shorthand came from a
697-line spec that was deleted because it had rotted: 67 mentions of architecture three
issues had removed, while `Main.mo` still cited it by section number. The glossary that
replaced it is one line per section — and within an hour of writing it, one row was
already **wrong in the dangerous direction**: it said `§5.3` was deleted (it labelled the
ICP burn cap) and told the reader a citation to it was a bug. In fact §5.3 held *two*
things, and the eight live citations all mean the surviving half — the 72 h max-wait
bound. A future agent following that row would have deleted eight correct comments.

That is the whole argument: a document nothing checks rots at the speed it is written.
The three checks below are what make the glossary maintainable rather than another
artifact to distrust.

  1. **Cited but not glossed** — a new `§N` appears in code with no row. The label is
     then unresolvable for everyone who did not write it.
  2. **Glossed but not cited** — a row nobody references. Keeps the file to what is
     worth keeping instead of growing back into a spec.
  3. **Pointer does not resolve** — the row names a module or symbol that no longer
     exists. This is the check that makes a RENAME update the glossary: move
     `Orders.isLegalTransition` and the gate fails until the row follows.

⚠️ **What this does NOT reach, stated because a check implying more than it verifies is
worse than no check:**

  - **Prose accuracy.** Nothing here could have caught the wrong `§5.3` row: it named a
    real section and pointed at real code, and was still wrong about *what the section
    meant*. That remains a human's job, and it is why rows are one line — a claim you
    can check by reading is better than one you cannot.
  - **Doc citations.** Only `src/backend/*.mo` and `test/*.mo` are scanned. In
    `RUNBOOK.md` and `docs/STRIPE.md` a bare `§2` means *that document's own* section 2,
    so scanning them would compare two different numbering schemes and produce noise.
    Code comments have no sections of their own, so there `§N` is unambiguous.

⚠️ **That last premise is ENFORCED rather than assumed.** A `§N` preceded by a document
name — `RUNBOOK §1` in a comment — would otherwise read as a citation of `DESIGN §1`, and
the "glossed but not cited" arm would pass over a section nothing in the code references.
So a document-scoped `§N` is refused: the glyph in code means a design section or it fails
here.
