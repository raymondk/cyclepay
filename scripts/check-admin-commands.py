"""Every mutating admin method is offered as a command, or excluded ON PURPOSE.

    scripts/check-admin-commands.py

The operator console renders an `icp canister call` per mutating method, pre-filled from
the row you are looking at. The table lives in `src/frontend/src/candid.ts` as
`CommandMethod`, and TypeScript makes a missing *renderer* a compile error — but it can
say nothing about a method that never made it into the union at all.

⚠️ **That gap is this script.** A new mutating admin method is a FAILURE here, never a
skip: absent from both the table and the exclusion list, it is a lever an operator has to
hand-author a command for, which is the transcription risk the console exists to
remove.

⚠️ **The exclusion list may only ever SHRINK**, and every entry carries why. Same
construction as `check-admin-tiers.py`'s tier table and `check-config-readers.py`'s
reader map: an exception that is visible in review and has to be defended.
