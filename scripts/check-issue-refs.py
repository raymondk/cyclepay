"""Fail if a tracked file outside `docs/agents/` carries a bare `#NN` issue reference.

An issue number reads as a pointer to a live requirement and is a pointer to a closed
argument. Worse, it *defers* the work: whatever the number stood for was never written
down in terms of the code, so the next reader has to leave the repo to find out what the
line means -- and the issue, once closed, no longer says what is true.

⚠️ **Why this is a gate step and not a convention.** `AGENTS.md` carried the rule in
prose for one commit; this repo's own position on that arrangement is written into
`check-heredocs.sh` and `test-all.sh` -- *a rule that needs remembering is a rule that
gets skipped*. The sweep that removed 1,117 of these left three behind, and the three
shared one shape (`#NN` followed by a semicolon) that a hand-written scan pattern had
excluded to skip mermaid's `#35;` escape. A check does not have that blind spot twice.

## What is allowed, and the exceptions may only ever SHRINK

  - **`docs/agents/`** -- the agent loop's own record rather than product. Both files
    there exist to point at issues.
  - **A repo-qualified reference to an EXTERNAL tracker**: `dfinity/icp-js-core#1384`.
    This is the standing exception in the owner's instructions -- *"only include issues
    if they refer to some bugfix or feature that we rely on"* -- and the qualified form
    is what makes it checkable: it names a tracker a reader can reach, about code this
    repo does not own. `src/frontend/src/ic-env.ts` is the live instance: it cites the
    upstream issue as the source of a measured header claim and as where the real fix
    belongs.
  - **Mermaid's `#35;` escape**, inside a mermaid fence only. Outside one, `#NN;` is a
    reference -- that is the exact case this check exists for.
  - **Two checkers whose SUBJECT is the syntax** -- `scripts/check-mermaid.py` and this
    file. Every occurrence in them is a literal inside a message, a doc line or a
    self-test vector. The exemption is on the file, never on the number: `#35` is also a
    real issue here, so exempting the token globally would open the hole this check
    exists to close. ⚠️ **The exemption is itself checked** -- `main()` fails if an
    exempt file has stopped containing a reference, so it cannot outlive its reason.

## Untracked files are scanned, and that is not optional

This shipped reading `git ls-files` alone, which lists only TRACKED files -- so its first
local run scanned everything except the checker being written, passed, and failed in CI
on its own self-test vectors. A green tick from a scan that never visited the file that
mattered is the exact defect this check exists to catch, so the fix is in the file list
(`--others --exclude-standard`) rather than in a rule a reader has to remember.

## The digit bound is deliberate

Only `#1`-`#9999` is flagged, and the match must not be followed by a word character.
That is what separates a reference from a CSS hex colour (`#868078`), an HTML numeric
entity (`&#8599;`), and a Markdown heading anchor (`](#2-what-the-canister-calls)`).
A run of five or more digits is a colour, not an issue -- `_self_test` pins every one of
these shapes, so widening the bound has to be a deliberate edit that fails the test first.
