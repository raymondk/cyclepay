# The full verification gate, in dependency order, fail-fast.
#
# AGENTS.md previously listed these as six commands to run by hand, which is how
# you end up reporting a task done on a partial run. This is the single entry
# point.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-all.sh              # everything (what CI runs; the only claimable run)
#   scripts/test-all.sh --fast       # skip the PocketIC suite (~30 s vs ~2 min)
#   scripts/test-all.sh --changed    # only the lanes the change can have broken
#   scripts/test-all.sh --changed=REF  # ...against REF instead of origin/main
#
# --changed is a LOCAL LOOP tool. It prints what it skipped and its summary says the
# run is partial, because a green tick over a lane that did not run is the failure
# this whole script exists to prevent. CI passes neither flag.
#
# The PocketIC suite needs a 4 KiB-page host (macOS, or x86_64 Linux). It cannot
# run in arm64 Linux guests with 16 KiB pages — the replica hard-asserts 4096-byte
# pages and the server dies at instance creation. --fast exists for that case; say
# the bar is unverified rather than inferring it from the unit tests.
# ⚠️ **`-E` (errtrace) is load-bearing, not decoration.** Without it the `ERR` trap
# below is NOT inherited by shell functions — and every step runs inside `run()` — so
# the gate exited on failure with no banner at all, only the failing tool's own output
# and a nonzero status. That is how a truncated run gets misread as a pass: there was
# nothing for a reader (or a grep) to find that said the gate itself had stopped.

# Two work-in-progress commits landed on `main` in one session — the branch had been

# before committing was written down both times, and the second time it still was not

#

# header is the same detector made explicit rather than incidental.
#

# refused would be wrong. It reports; the reader decides.
# ⚠️ **Detached HEAD gets named, not printed as the word "HEAD".** `--abbrev-ref` answers
# `HEAD` when detached, which reads like a branch called HEAD and hides exactly the state
# this header exists to surface: a checkout where "which branch am I on" has no answer and

# ⚠️ **Measured before it was built, because the obvious answer was wrong.** The
# complaint that prompted this was "the UI tests make the loop slow". They do not:
# on a full green run the frontend suite is 2.4 s and the browser specs 10.2 s, out
# of minutes. The time is in the Motoko compile (`mops check`, `mops build`) and the
# PocketIC suite at 61 s. Skipping the UI tests would have saved 3% and deleted the
# only coverage of the cascade.
#
# So the lever is which LANE runs at all, not which suite gets deleted.
#
# ⚠️ **The default is still everything, and CI must never pass `--changed`.** This is

# not recognise activates EVERY lane, and a step name it does not recognise RUNS.
