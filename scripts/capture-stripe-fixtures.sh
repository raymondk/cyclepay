# Capture REAL Stripe event bodies as test fixtures.
#
# Why: every Stripe payload in this repo is JSON we wrote from the API docs. The
# suites therefore prove the canister matches *our reading* of Stripe, not Stripe.
# That has already bitten once — a unit test "covered" delayed-payment settlement by
# sending a second `checkout.session.completed`, an event Stripe does not send.
#
# This script listens with `stripe listen --print-json`, sorts each event into
# test/integration/fixtures/<name>.json, and tells you which are still missing. Run
# it, perform the actions it lists, Ctrl-C. No copy-pasting from the Dashboard.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/capture-stripe-fixtures.sh                 # capture + forward to a local gateway
#   scripts/capture-stripe-fixtures.sh --no-forward    # capture only, do not deliver anywhere
#   scripts/capture-stripe-fixtures.sh --status        # what has been captured so far
#
# Prerequisites:
#   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe jq
#   stripe login            # choose a SANDBOX account, never live

# ⚠️ **Run the CLI with STRIPE_API_KEY UNSET, deliberately.**
#
# The Stripe CLI prefers `STRIPE_API_KEY` from the environment over its own `stripe login`
# credential — and the key we tell operators to export is the **restricted** `rk_` one,
# scoped to write Checkout Sessions and nothing else. `stripe listen` opens a CLI session,
# which needs `stripecli_session_write`; a correctly-scoped rk_ key does not have it and
# **must not**. So exporting the key for the backend silently breaks the CLI:
#
#   FATAL Error while authenticating with Stripe: Authorization failed, status=403
#   "code": "more_permissions_required" … key 'rk_test_…' does not have the required
#   permissions … Enabling Debugging Tools Write ('stripecli_session_write') …
#
# The wrong fix is widening that key. The right one is this: the CLI uses its keychain
# login, the canister uses the restricted key, and neither borrows the other's credential.

cat <<'NOTES'
Perform the actions listed above. Each captured event is written as it arrives;
re-running an action overwrites its fixture, so a bad capture is easy to redo.

Anything shown as `stripe trigger …` needs no Dashboard setup — run it in another
terminal while this is listening. Those bodies are Stripe's own canned fixtures
rather than the output of a real payment, which is still far better than the
hand-written JSON they replace, but note the distinction for the async pair: a
real SEPA settlement is the thing group F of docs/SANDBOX-TESTPLAN.md exercises.

⚠️ `checkout.session.completed.unpaid` needs no special effort: triggering
`checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` emits the WHOLE delayed sequence, which
begins with a real `completed` carrying `payment_status: unpaid`. An earlier version
of this script sent you to create a SEPA session by hand and pay it with a test
IBAN — unnecessary, and nobody found out until someone ran the triggers and got the
fixture anyway.

⚠️ **A `payment_intent: null` fixture is deliberately NOT on this list.** This app pins
`payment_method_types[]=card` at a fixed unit_amount above the $10 floor with no promo
codes, so `payment_intent` is never absent — and an explicit `payment_method_types`
overrides whatever the account has enabled, so "a delayed method could be enabled at
account level" is not a reachable justification. The handler stays and is covered by a
crafted body in `test/webhook.test.mo`, which is honest: capture exists because crafted
JSON encodes our assumptions about what Stripe *sends us*, and for a payload it will
never send there is nothing to be wrong about. If a non-card method is ever enabled — a product
decision, not a config accident — capture becomes necessary again, because then the
real shape is load-bearing.

Ctrl-C when the list is complete.

NOTES

# `--print-json` emits one JSON object per line. Sort by type, and by the field that
# distinguishes the variants we care about — paid vs unpaid, full vs partial refund,
# and the missing-payment_intent case a zero-amount or subscription session produces.
# ⚠️ **`--format json`, not the deprecated `--print-json`.** The CLI now warns on the old
# flag ("Please use `--format json` instead"), and a deprecated flag eventually stops being
# accepted — at which point this script would fail in the way described just below.
#
# ⚠️ **stderr is NOT redirected, and that is a fix rather than an oversight.** This line
# used to end `2>/dev/null`, which hid Stripe's "Ready! … signing secret" banner *and*
# every reason it might refuse: an expired session, a revoked key, an account problem. The
# pipeline then ended, the script exited **0**, and the operator got their prompt back with
# no output and no error — indistinguishable from "nothing happened". That is exactly the
# quiet-inertness this repo keeps removing from the canister, in our own tooling. The
# banner on stderr is noise worth paying for.
