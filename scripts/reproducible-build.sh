# Reproducible release build wrapper (spec §8).
#
#   scripts/reproducible-build.sh [git-ref] [outdir]
#
# Builds <git-ref> (default HEAD) inside the pinned container and writes
# backend.wasm / frontend.wasm / backend.did / MODULE-HASHES.txt to <outdir>
# (default release/). The context is the committed tree only — so the resulting
# hashes are a pure function of the ref. Verifiers run the same command on the
# release tag and diff MODULE-HASHES.txt against the published one and against
# `icp canister status --public`.
#
# ⚠️ **`git archive` does NOT include submodules, and the pinned crypto is one.**
# A plain `git archive | docker build` produces a context whose
# `vendor/icp-seeding-secrets-poc/` is empty, and the build then fails inside the
# container on a `mops` path dependency that resolves to nothing. So the context is
# assembled explicitly below: the superproject tree, then the submodule tree overlaid at
# its own path.
#
# ⚠️ **The submodule commit is read FROM THE REF**, via `<ref>:<path>` — not from whatever
# the working tree happens to have checked out. That is what preserves the property this
# whole script exists for: same ref in, same bytes out, regardless of local state.
