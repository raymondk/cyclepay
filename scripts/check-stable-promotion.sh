# Decide whether a `deployed/backend.most` promotion is REPRESENTATION-ONLY or a real
# shape change — before it is committed.
#
# **Why this exists.** A promotion resets the reference point the upgrade check
# compares against, so it is the one operation that can blind that check. One hole is a
# baseline left stale; the mirror image is a baseline promoted past a real change because
# the diff looked like noise. Both are invisible in a `git diff`.
#
# A compiler upgrade renumbers every type hash: moc 1.9.0 → 1.15.1 moved 91 lines of
# `deployed/backend.most` without changing one field. A real schema change lands in the
# same file, in the same shape of diff. Eyeballing cannot separate them; this can.
#
# The test is MUTUAL stable-compatibility. `moc --stable-compatible A B` asks "can a
# canister whose signature is A upgrade to B". Run both ways:
#
# ⚠️ **The load-bearing premise, written down because the whole classification rests on
# it: dropping a stable field is NOT backward-compatible.** If it were, adding a field
# would pass BOTH directions and be reported as "REPRESENTATION-ONLY, safe to promote
# without review" — precisely the misclassification this script exists to prevent.
# Measured on moc 1.15.1 with two hand-written signatures (`actor { stable a : Nat }` vs
# the same plus `stable b : Nat`): adding exits 0, dropping exits 1 with
#
#     Compatibility error [M0169], stable variable `b` of the previous version cannot be
#     implicitly discarded. The variable can only be dropped by an explicit migration
#     function.
#
# `assert_asymmetry` below re-establishes that on every run, so a future moc that relaxed
# M0169 fails loudly here instead of silently downgrading a real field addition to
# "no review needed". A premise this script cannot survive losing is a premise it should
# not take on trust.
#
#   both pass  → the signatures are mutual subtypes, i.e. EQUIVALENT. The diff is pure
#                renumbering and the promotion carries no shape change.
#   only 1 → 2 → a real, upgrade-compatible change (a new stable field, a widened type).
#                Promote deliberately, and say in the commit what moved.
#   1 → 2 fails → the change is NOT upgrade-compatible. Promoting it strands every
#                deployed canister; that needs a migration chain, not a promotion.
#
# ⚠️ **`--accept-reinstall` is the one deliberate override**, and it exists because
# "not upgrade-compatible" is a legitimate answer pre-launch: with no migration chain
# and no data worth preserving, a reinstall is the documented loop and the baseline
# should then describe the NEW shape. The flag does not weaken the check — it still
# refuses silently-wrong promotions — it makes the operator say the words, and it prints
# **which stable variables are dropped**, because "what state is lost" is the reviewable
# fact in that decision. Never pass it once real data exists.
