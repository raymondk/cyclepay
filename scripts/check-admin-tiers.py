"""Every admin-gated method is in exactly one tier, and CALLS the guard its tier declares.

    scripts/check-admin-tiers.py

⚠️ **Membership is not the property that matters.** A list of methods plus a check that
every admin method appears in it proves the list is COMPLETE — it proves nothing about
whether the code honours it. A method filed as controller-only whose body calls the
delegable guard would satisfy such a check while being delegable in fact. So this asserts,
per method, that the guard in its body is the one its tier requires.

⚠️ **The population is DERIVED from the source, never declared.** A method is admin-gated
if its body calls one of the guards, so a new one that is in neither tier fails here. A
hand-written population would let a new method be admin-gated and unlisted at the same
time, which is the state this exists to make impossible.

⚠️ **This check and `check-doc-surface.py` COMPOSE, and neither covers the gap alone.** The
population here is guard-derived, so a method MEANT to be admin-gated that forgot the guard
entirely is invisible here — it simply looks public. What catches that is the
`unclassifiable` outcome in `check-doc-surface.py`: a method taking `{ caller }` calling
neither guard nor an owner helper fails there by name. **Relaxing `unclassifiable` when it
gets noisy reopens an authz hole this file cannot see.**

The tiers, and the line between them: **an admin resolves individual cases; a controller
changes the rules.** Anything that moves secrets, pricing, the gate, the mode, the
delivery bounds or the admin list itself is the RULES tier — a controller can already
upgrade and drain the canister, so that tier is canister control. The per-order decisions,
the operator reads and the idempotent levers are the CASES tier: an admin can end one
order and cannot upgrade the canister.
