/// Pins the tier table in `docs/BUYER-COST-MODEL.md` to **this canister's own arithmetic**.
///
/// ⚠️ **Why this exists: that document reimplemented the fee formula, and a reimplementation
/// cannot check itself.** The doc carries a Python snippet for reproducing its figures, and
/// because the snippet is the same transcription the table came from, running it confirms
/// only that the transcription is self-consistent. It said `$5 → $4.56 net` while
/// `Pricing.feeCents` **ceilings** the basis-point part — `(gross × bps + 9_999) / 10_000` —
/// which nets $4.55. $5 was the only tier where floor and ceiling differ, so nothing else
/// in the table was wrong and nothing in the doc could have caught it.
///
/// So the numbers a reader acts on are asserted here against `Pricing.feeCents` and
/// `Pricing.cyclesForCents`, and the fee constants are compared to `Pricing.defaultConfig()`
/// rather than merely restated — so a change to either the formula or the configuration
/// fails this suite with the tier that moved.
///
/// ⚠️ **What this does NOT pin.** The cost side — creation fee, storage rate, ingress bytes
/// — has no oracle in this repo: those are the IC's published prices, and the doc cites the
/// source. This covers the half that *is* ours.

/// `Pricing.defaultConfig()`'s fee, restated so the expected figures below are readable
/// without chasing a constant.
///
/// ⚠️ **A restatement on its own is BLINDNESS, not a safeguard** — it is pinned to
/// `defaultConfig()` by the first test in the suite. Without that comparison, changing
/// `Pricing.defaultConfig()` to 320/50 leaves all 765 unit tests green while every figure
/// in `docs/BUYER-COST-MODEL.md` and both propagations in `Gate.mo` silently re-base: $5
/// would buy 3.160 T at a 13.2% fee share and $10 6.684 T at 8.2%. Measured.

///
/// ⚠️ **ICP is an intermediate unit and cancels** — `cyclesForCents` divides
/// `xdrPermyriadPerIcp` by `usdPerIcpMicros`, so only their ratio matters and the ICP price
/// chosen here is arbitrary. $4.55/ICP is used because it is the §3 vector's, which keeps
