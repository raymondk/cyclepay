  // `append` takes no `capacity`, so "drops oldest first" and "seq stays monotonic
  // across drops" are not expressible here — which is stronger than a test asserting
  // the cap is large.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Their heirs, because a deleted test needs one named:**
  //   - "nothing is ever dropped" below is the direct replacement: it is the same
  //     property inverted, and it is the one that would fail if a cap came back.
  //   - `seq` monotonicity survives as a claim in its own right, tested below without
  //     reference to drops. Readers used gaps in `seq` to DETECT drops; with no drops
  //     there are no gaps, so what is left to pin is that `seq` never repeats.
