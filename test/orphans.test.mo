// all unrepresentable here rather than merely untested.
//
// ⚠️ **Their heirs, because a deleted test needs one named:**
//   - The first test's property — an unresolved obligation is never dropped — became
//     **unrepresentable rather than untested**. Nothing is dropped at all now, which is
//     strictly stronger than "not this one", and the suite below pins it.
//   - The second and third were about *which* entries eviction preferred. With no
//     eviction there is no preference to get wrong. What survives from them is the
//     property they were protecting, `unresolvedCount`, which the resolution suite
//     already covers directly.
//   - The §4.1 invariant they existed for — every verified dollar resolves to a
//     delivery or an obligation — is now carried by `test/webhook.test.mo`'s orphan
//     fallback test, which is the only place a problem can still fail to find a home.
