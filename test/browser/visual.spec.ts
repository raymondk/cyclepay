/// Pixel baselines for the two surfaces a visitor decides on, in both themes.
///
/// These cover the class of bug no assertion in this suite can reach: PAINT.
/// Text the same colour as its background, an element covering another, an
/// opacity that makes something technically visible and practically not — every
/// one of those passes `toBeVisible()`, passes a `getComputedStyle` check on the
/// property somebody thought to check, and is obvious in a picture.
///
/// **A baseline is only evidence if a human looked at it.** These were reviewed
/// when first generated. Update them deliberately:
///
///   npm --prefix test/browser test -- --update-snapshots visual.spec.ts
///
/// and look at the new PNGs before committing them.
///
/// ⚠️ **Baselines are LINUX-ONLY, and these tests skip on any other platform.**
/// Playwright suffixes per platform because font rasterisation differs, so a
/// darwin set was committed alongside — and it bought a signal for a rasteriser
/// nothing ships on, at a second set to regenerate on every deliberate change.
/// Worse, a Mac cannot repair the `-linux` half that CI actually compares against
/// (see below), so the darwin half could never substitute for it. Linux-only makes
/// every failure reproducible where it is checked.
///
/// **The `-linux` set has to come from the CI runner itself.** Generating it in
/// `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.62.1-noble` at `--platform linux/amd64` —
/// the same image and architecture CI uses — was tried first and produced ~2,400
/// differing pixels against the runner, all of it text antialiasing. Same image is
/// not the same rasteriser.
///
/// So the procedure is: push, let CI fail, and take its own renders. The
/// `browser-failures` artifact (uploaded on failure by the workflow) contains
/// `*-actual.png` for every mismatch. **Look at them**, then copy them over the
/// `-linux` baselines and push again. Two consecutive attempts in one CI run were
/// byte-identical, so the runner is deterministic enough for this to be stable
/// until the runner image itself changes.
///
/// Tolerance stays at Playwright's default (zero differing pixels above the 0.2
/// colour threshold) on purpose. The defect these baselines found — a 5px dot and
/// a 1px hairline painted over four digits — is about a hundred pixels, so any
/// tolerance loose enough to absorb cross-environment noise would also have hidden
/// it. Regenerating on a runner-image bump is the price of that.
///
/// ⚠️ **`--app localhost:5178` is baked into the CLI page's baseline, and that is the
/// test server's port, not documentation.** The page derives it from
/// `window.location.host`, so under Playwright it is correct and under any other origin
/// it differs. Do not read the deployed `--app` value off this picture — `config.ts` is
/// where that value comes from.
///
/// The market comes from the fixture backend, so the amounts, the rate strip and
/// the fee line are fixed numbers rather than whatever a gateway last said. Under
/// the unreachable-gateway default these shots would be pictures of an error
/// state, which is not the thing worth pinning.

/// Everything that makes a shot reproducible: no motion, fonts settled, one
/// viewport.
