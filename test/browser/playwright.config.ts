/// Browser specs for the frontend.
///
/// These exist because the jsdom suite is structurally blind to a whole class of
/// bug, and that blindness shipped: a class selector's `display` outranks the UA
/// stylesheet's `[hidden] { display: none }`, so an audience chooser the app had
/// hidden stayed on screen and a disabled rail nav was always visible — while
/// every DOM test passed, because `el.hidden` was true and jsdom has no cascade
/// and no layout.
///
/// Anything asserted here must be about **rendering and reachability**. Backend
/// behaviour belongs in the PocketIC suite; UI state transitions belong in
/// main.test.ts, which is far faster.
///
/// Serves a **production build** over a plain static server, not `vite dev`.
/// Two reasons, both load-bearing:
///   - `vite.config.ts` shells out to `icp network status` at config load, so dev
///     mode cannot start without a running local network. These specs must not
///     need one, or they will not run in CI and will rot.
///   - the bundle is the artifact that actually ships. A bundler transform that
///     only breaks in production is exactly the sort of thing a dev-server spec
///     misses.
///
/// `dist-fixtures/` rather than `dist/`: the same `vite build`, with
/// CYCLEPAY_FIXTURES=1 adding the test-only hook that makes the post-purchase
/// surfaces reachable (src/frontend/src/fixtures.ts). A separate outDir because
/// `dist/` is what a deploy uploads, and a bundle carrying the hook must never be
/// sitting there waiting to be shipped. `scripts/test-all.sh` asserts the shipping
/// bundle has no hook in it.
///
/// The backend is unreachable on purpose (see fixtures.ts): what renders must not
/// depend on the gateway answering, and the specs that DO need answers install the
/// canned backend explicitly.
