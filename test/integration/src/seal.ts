 * and `CONTEXT`/`KEY_LABEL` drifting from `src/backend/Sealed.mo` produces
 * `#notSealedToThisCanister` — an error that reads like the canister's fault.
 *
 * ⚠️ **PocketIC's master key, always.** This suite only ever runs against PocketIC, so
 * unlike `scripts/seal-secret.sh` there is nothing to choose here. The mainnet master key

 * from a top-level `@icp-sdk/core` yields a SECOND nominal `Principal` whose private
 * `_arr` is incompatible — and `gw.backendId` comes from pic's copy. That produced four
