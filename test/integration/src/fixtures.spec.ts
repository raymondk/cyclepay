// Real-Stripe-payload parity.
//
// Every other Stripe payload in this repo is JSON we wrote from the API docs, so the
// suites prove the canister matches *our reading* of Stripe rather than Stripe. This
// file closes that gap: it parses **recorded real event bodies** and asserts the
// canister's parser extracts what we expect, and that the crafted equivalents agree.
//
// It has already been earned once — a unit test "covered" delayed-payment settlement
// by sending a second `checkout.session.completed`, which Stripe does not send.
//
// ⚠️ Every test here **skips** when its fixture is absent, so the suite stays green
// before anyone has captured them. Skipped is not passed: `--status` on the capture
// script is the source of truth for what is still missing.
