  //      so the promise-holder count is RE-READ afterwards and the withdrawal refuses if
  //      it moved. Without that, a create queued there is admitted and the buyer walks
  //      away with a payable session against a reserve about to leave.
  //   2. the transfer — the floor is decremented SYNCHRONOUSLY before it, so a create
  //      arriving there is refused by `Gate.solvent` for free.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Rule 1 is now STRUCTURAL rather than reviewed**: `observeReserve` returns the
  // post-await holder count alongside the `quiet` flag it computes for the same reason,
  // so the value arrives with the result and there is nothing to forget. Rule 2 — the
  // decrement before the transfer — still rests on review.
  //
  // **Rule 2 IS verified, by 103g above** — and the reasoning that says it cannot be is
  // the trap. *"A `pic.tick()` drains the whole message including its inter-canister
  // awaits, so there is no way to land an ingress message inside one"* generalises "these
  // tests do not catch it" into "no test can", and it is false: `pic.tick(1)` advances
  // ONE round rather than to quiescence, so a deferred call parks across rounds and
  // ingress lands in between. 103g runs the mutation (the decrement moved after the
  // transfer) and is the only scenario of 115 that fails on it.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Rule 1 remains unverified, and here is what was tried** — recorded as a
  // measurement, not as a claim that no test can exist:
  //
  //   - `deferredAdmin.withdraw_reserve()` and `deferredUser.create_order()` submitted
  //     together, then `tick(1)` per round, reading `reserve_status` and the ledger
  //     balance each round. The withdrawal completed inside round 1 — balance already 0
  //     — and the create was then refused `#reserveShort`. Its ledger reply and
  //     continuation run ahead of the queued ingress.
  //   - The same with the create submitted after one tick: no outcall, same refusal.
  //
  // So the create never lands between the balance read and the holder re-check. Rule 1
  // is structural rather than reviewed — `observeReserve` returns the post-await count
  // with its result, so there is nothing to forget — and 103g covers rule 2.
  //
  // An earlier version of this test asserted "a withdrawal and a create can never both
  // succeed" and passed for the wrong reason every time: the withdrawal simply finished
  // first (`withdrew=true, created=false, outcall=false`), so the create was refused
  // post-drain and the interleave never happened. That is a safety assertion that cannot
  // fail — worse than no test, because it reads as proof.
  //
  // What IS pinned: the predicate both rules depend on (103b — holders > 0 refuses), the
  // observable end state (below), and rule 2's ordering (103g). Rule 1 rests on review of
  // the comment in `withdraw_reserve` and on the pattern it copies from `observeReserve`,
