  1. Forward real Stripe events here:

     stripe listen --forward-to '${webhookUrl}'

     ⚠ The secret must match. Either export it before starting this script:
         STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(stripe listen --print-secret)" npm run sandbox
       or the built-in test secret is in use (crafted events only).

  2. Create an order (as the test user identity):

     printed stripeSessionUrl → open it. That IS the payment page: the canister
     created a Checkout Session and set client_reference_id on it through the
     API, so there is nothing to append. Or drive it headlessly:

     stripe trigger checkout.session.completed \\
       --override checkout_session:client_reference_id=<ref>

  3. Watch it deliver. The recovery timer is armed; money-out runs for real
     against the CMC.

  4. Clicking through the real UI against this instance is NOT wired up yet.
     The frontend signs in with mainnet Internet Identity, which this instance
     trusts — but the page also needs the backend id and root key, which the
     asset canister normally supplies via an ic_env cookie and PocketIC does not
     set. A local II (the 'ii' ICP feature) currently breaks instance creation;
     see the note in harness.ts. Until that is resolved, UI click-through is the
     one part of the plan that needs a mainnet deploy in Stripe TEST mode.

     VITE_II_URL already exists as the override for when a local II works.

  Config in effect (DEV values — never mainnet): delivery alert after 2 min
  (mainnet: 2 h), max hold 72 h, expected livemode = false. There is no order
  TTL of ours — the deadline is the Stripe session's own ~35 minutes.
