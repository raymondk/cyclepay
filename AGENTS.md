## ICP skills

ICP skills are tested, frequently-updated instruction files maintained by DFINITY
(<https://skills.internetcomputer.org>). Consult the relevant skill **before**
making changes — the `writing-motoko`, `icp-cli`, and `canister-security` skills all
contradict pre-training knowledge in ways that matter here.

**This repo uses [autosync](https://skills.internetcomputer.org/skills/autosync-ic-skills).**
A committed `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/sync-ic-skills.sh`)
mirrors the published skills into `.claude/skills/` at the start of every session,
so they stay current with **nothing to commit** when a skill changes. The skills
directory itself is gitignored. The first time it runs, Claude Code asks you to
trust the hook.

Why this replaced the old `skills-lock.json` pin: the lock had drifted badly and
nothing surfaced it. At the moment of the switch it listed **six skills that
upstream no longer published** — four of them still sitting on disk being read as
authoritative — and was **missing four** that had since been added. One was not a
deletion but a rename: `asset-canister` → `static-site`. A pin only records what
you last ran; it cannot tell you the world moved.

<!-- ic-skills:managed:start -->
<!-- state: configured (autosync) -->
ICP skills auto-update each session via a SessionStart hook
(`.claude/sync-ic-skills.sh`) and live in your agent skills directory — you don't
need to run anything to refresh them. Skills are authoritative — prefer them over
general knowledge for all ICP work. If they are not present (hook hasn't run, or
`jq` is missing), fetch them on demand per the fallback below.
<!-- ic-skills:managed:end -->

**On-demand fallback** (any agent, no hook needed): the hook is Claude Code-only,
so Cursor, Copilot, Codex and friends should fetch the index once per session from
`https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/index.json`, then fetch the
matching skill's `SKILL.md` before writing ICP code for a task.

**Layout note:** `.claude` is a committed symlink to `.agents`, so the two real
files live at `.agents/settings.json` and `.agents/sync-ic-skills.sh` and are
tracked there. Everything still resolves under the `.claude/` paths the hook and
Claude Code expect. `.agents/skills/` is gitignored.

Two places this project knowingly departs from skill guidance, both with
recorded reasoning — don't "fix" them without reading the rationale:

- **`canister-security` pitfall 9** ("never store API secrets in canister
  state"). The Stripe webhook signing secret *is* stored plaintext, by design.
  HMAC is symmetric, so a canister that can verify can forge — encryption only
  moves the problem to a key the canister also needs. See `src/backend/Secret.mo`
  and `docs/STRIPE.md` §7. Confidentiality comes from the SEV-SNP subnet, and the
  **reserve balance is the blast radius** — a forged webhook delivers from it, and
  nothing caps that, so the reserve is sized to what a leak could cost.
- **`writing-motoko` architecture pattern — now followed, with one naming difference.**
  ⚠️ **This entry used to claim a departure that no longer exists**, so read the shape in
  the code rather than a memory of this file:

  - **Endpoints are in `src/backend/mixins/`**, nine of them split by feature, and
    `Main.mo` declares **no public methods**. `docs/DESIGN.md` §9.1 has the rules
    that split rests on — chiefly that `include` passes its arguments **by value**, so
    mutable state is grouped into records and transient state arrives as closures.
  - **The `lib/` layer is flat modules rather than a `lib/` directory**, and that is the
    remaining difference: `Orders`, `Delivery`, `Gate`, `Reserve`, `Pricing`, `Receipts`,
    `rails/Card` with its explicit `Card.Deps`. Stateless, state as a parameter, which is
    what lets the whole ingestion path unit-test with no IC environment. Equivalent
    separation under a different filename; nothing about it is a departure in substance.
  - **A3, and why nine endpoint bodies exceed 20 code lines anyway.** The rule is
    "if a body is more than authorize → delegate → map, the middle belongs in a module",
    and the decisions that were extractable have been: `create_order`'s — amount,
    admission, quote, the caller's floor — is `Purchase.plan`, which is what made its
    **error precedence** unit-testable rather than reachable only through PocketIC.
    ⚠️ **In the nine bodies still over the line, the length is the RETURN TYPE or the
    guards, not logic** — `reserve_status` is 16 of 33 lines of inline record type,
    `operator_summary` 11 of 23. A3 is about logic, and a return type is neither, so
    those are not pending work: the metric counts type lines. Measure a body as
    non-blank, non-comment lines INCLUSIVE of the `public …func` line and the closing
    `};`, because a reviewer and I differed by exactly those two.
  - ⚠️ **`check-did-signatures.sh` is an IDENTITY check, not a compatibility one, and it
    is not the authority on whether a deliberate interface edit is safe.** Naming an
    inline return record is `didc`-compatible in both directions — Candid is structural,
    so a type alias is not part of the wire type — and this script still reports it as
    changed, correctly for its own job: proving a relocation moved nothing. There is no
    compatibility check in the gate (`didc` is not wired in), so a deliberate change
    needs that judgement made by hand.
  - ⚠️ **Extracting a decision buys TESTS, not a smaller body.** Measured: one
    extraction left the body the same length and another made it LARGER, because a named
    ladder call site is longer than the inline `if` it replaces. What it buys is that the
    decision becomes checkable without an IC environment — `Purchase.plan`'s error
    precedence, `Orders.cancelShape`'s whole status space. So do not read a body over the
    line as work not done, and do not chase the count by moving code that has nowhere
    better to live.
  - ⚠️ **One part of A3 is a STATED EXCEPTION, not unfinished work.** `create_order`'s
    body keeps commit → outcall → re-check → attach. The commit takes the reserve hold in
    a block with no `await` and the order id IS the `client_reference_id`, so the sequence
    cannot be rearranged; it needs actor capabilities (`raw_rand`, the outcall) and moving
    it into a module would make it harder to see, not easier. Two integration scenarios
    guard it — 67b (the hold exists while the outcall is parked) and 67c (the cycles
    delivered are the cycles held, across a price move) — and each was mutation-verified
    against the specific defect it covers. **Do not "finish" A3 by moving that block.**

  ⚠️ **A recorded departure is a claim with a scope, and it expires.** The previous
  version of this entry was written about `lib/` and then read as covering the monolith
  too, which is how an agent skips a finding nobody decided to accept. When a skill and
  this file disagree, the skill wins unless the reasoning here says why *for that
  specific finding* — and if the reasoning has expired, fix this file rather than working
  around it.

## Running it locally

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive   # first time only
icp network start -d && icp deploy && scripts/local-dev-seed.sh
```

**`docs/OPERATE.md`, Mode 1, is the procedure** — the submodule, the seed, the
iteration loops and the troubleshooting table. Two things it explains that will
otherwise cost you an hour: the pinned crypto submodule is a `mops` path dependency,
so without it nothing compiles and the error names a missing package rather than a
missing submodule; and the seed is **not optional**, because a fresh deploy is
fail-closed on five separate axes at once and presents as a broken app.

This section deliberately carries no copy of that procedure. It had one, and it drifted
— it claimed four axes where the README said five, and the axis it omitted was the one
the README calls "the one nobody guesses".

### Do not cycle the network

`icp network start` takes **minutes**, and **two projects cannot run local
networks at once** (the fixed `gateway.port: 8000` in `icp.yaml`).

- **Check first** with `icp network status`. If one is running, **use it** — do
  not restart it to get a clean slate.
- **Start only if absent**, and remember that you started it.
- **Never stop a network you did not start.** You cannot tell whether a human is
  mid-manual-run, or whether the network belongs to another project. Stopping one
  has already destroyed a session's worth of delivered test orders, their audit
  trail, and a local Internet Identity registration.
- **For a clean slate, reinstall — do not restart.** `icp deploy --mode reinstall
  --yes` then `scripts/local-dev-seed.sh` takes seconds and is the documented loop
  for a stable-shape change; a network restart takes minutes and throws away more
  than you wanted.
- **Leave it running when you finish**, and say so in the PR. The next piece of
  work needs it.

## Scope: the Card rail is the product

CyclePay onboards developers who have **no ICP, no wallet, and no exchange
account**. That is the whole point, and it is why the Stripe rail gets the
attention: for that user a stablecoin rail is not an option, because acquiring
the stablecoin is the same problem over again.

The card rail is the only rail — a second, disabled ck-USDC rail was removed,
because carrying a rail we do not ship made every other change bigger.

`Types.Rail` stays a single-case variant so a future rail is an additive change
rather than a schema-wide edit — the same reasoning as `Types.Owner`.

## Project conventions

- **`icp-cli`, never `dfx`.** Project config is `icp.yaml`; Motoko deps are
  `mops.toml` / `mops.lock`.
- **Comments document what the code does.** Not what it used to do, and not a
  judgement on an earlier implementation. Design history belongs in **commit
  messages and GitHub issues**, where it is dated and attributable; a comment saying
  "this was previously wrong" is noise to everyone who reads the file later. ⚠️ The
  exception, and it is narrow: a comment that stops a future mistake stays, written as
  a **rule** rather than as a story about a past change.
- ⚠️ **The ⚠️ marker is for a TRAP, not for a fact**, and
  `scripts/check-markers.py` enforces the part a check can own. The test is: *can the
  next editor act on this the wrong way, and would the damage be unrecoverable or
  invisible?* **"Do not add a force flag to `refresh_reserve`"** earns it — the flag
  reintroduces the bug the predicate prevents. **"This count going LOW is the oversell
  direction"** does not: it is orientation, it keeps every word of its text, and it loses
  the glyph. The marker only works while it is rare, and the asymmetry is why it matters:
  an unread warning on the money path costs more than a missing one, because its presence
  is what a reviewer trusts.
  - **Never in a test, suite or describe NAME** (enforced). The name states the property;
    the glyph adds nothing and prints on every run.
  - **The population may only FALL** (enforced): `MARKER_CEILING` is the tree-wide total
    and the check fails on any disagreement in either direction. A new marker is a
    one-line ceiling edit with the reason in the commit, and a cleanup pass ratchets it
    down visibly in the diff.
  - **A comment block with three markers almost certainly has one trap and two
    explanations** — worth checking against the phrase test above. Judgement, not a rule.
  - **An endpoint `///` doc is PUBLISHED** into `backend.did` and the generated
    TypeScript, so a marker there reaches API callers. Keep the ones a caller can act on
    (*"uncertified query answers, nothing may be wired to decide on them"*); a note to the
    next editor about our own layout or history belongs in a `//` beside the
    implementation. `PUBLISHED_CEILING` ratchets that count the same way.
- ⚠️ **No bare `#NN` issue reference outside `docs/agents/`**, and
  `scripts/check-issue-refs.py` enforces it. Not in code, not in tests, not in docs, not
  in scripts, not in a suite or test name. An issue number reads as a pointer to a live
  requirement and is a pointer to a closed argument — and it defers the work: whatever
  the reference stood for has to be said here, in terms of the code as it is now, or
  dropped. Name the mechanism, the file, or the rule instead.
  - `docs/agents/` is exempt: it is agent process rather than product, and both files
    there exist to point at issues.
  - ⚠️ **An EXTERNAL tracker stays, written qualified** — `dfinity/icp-js-core#1384`,
    never the number on its own. This is the narrow case worth keeping: an issue we
    *rely on*,
    about code this repo does not own, where the number is the only way a reader reaches
    the claim's source. `src/frontend/src/ic-env.ts` is the live instance. The qualified
    form is what makes the distinction checkable rather than a judgement call.
- ⚠️ **There is no `design-docs/` any more, and its deletion is the cautionary tale
  for this rule.** Three files, 1,252 lines, no staleness banner — and 67 mentions in
  one of them of architecture that had already been removed, while `Main.mo` and
  `Types.mo` still cited it by section number. Two of its claims had been **reversed**,
  not merely outdated, so a reader was carrying the opposite of the truth. What was
  still true is `docs/DESIGN.md` — 215 lines against 1,252, holding decisions and
  nothing else.
- ⚠️ **Comment volume is a defect, and deleting a comment is the one change with no
  failure signal.** No compiler error, no red test, and the diff shows what left but not
  what was lost. So three rules, front-loaded because nothing downstream can catch a bad
  call:
  1. **Name the mistake the comment prevents** — and the test is **"would the next
     editor of THIS function get it wrong without this line?"**, not "is this true and
     worth knowing". Almost all of this prose is true and worth knowing; that is why the
     weaker reading keeps everything.
     - ⚠️ **Keeper**, because a general rule would be misapplied here without it:
       *"Unbounded input on purpose… a cap would only buy silent truncation."* The repo
       has a paginate-everything rule, so the next person applying it uniformly would cap
       this query and break it.
     - ⚠️ **Not a keeper**, because nobody editing that function is about to undo it:
       *"It no longer discloses the cycles-ledger fee."* The principle inside it — the
       canister owns what only it knows, the ledger owns what it owns — belongs in
       `docs/DESIGN.md`, where it applies to more than one function.
  1b. ⚠️ **A comment is about the CODE, not about itself.** Technically covered by
     "history belongs in commits", but the hazard is distinct and compounds: the comment
     becomes about its own biography, a reader spends attention on the document rather
     than the code, and the next correction adds a layer (*"an earlier version of this
     note said…"*). Delete on sight: *"This paragraph said X and both halves stopped
     being true"*, *"An earlier version argued Y. That argument was wrong."* Keep the
     rule; drop the story.
  1c. ⚠️ **Two opening sentences that both describe what the function does means one is
     a leftover.** New line added, old one not deleted, both surviving as adjacent
     summaries — found three times (`Orphans.add`, `Orphans:283`, `AuditLog.append`),
     twice still promising a field that no longer exists. Deliberately **not** a gate
     step: distinguishing a leftover from a legitimate two-sentence summary is fuzzy, and
     a noisy check gets ignored. It is cheap for a human reading a doc block, so it is a
     review-attention item.
  2. **Never delete without a destination.** Every removed comment either lands in
     `docs/DESIGN.md` or is rewritten as a **rule at the site**. A removal with no
     destination is what a reviewer should scrutinise — it is the only case where they
     have nothing to compare against.
  3. **The commit message carries the mapping** — what moved where. It is the only
     recoverable record if a judgement turns out wrong. ⚠️ **State the glob when you
     quote a count**: `src/backend/*.mo` excludes `src/backend/rails/`, and four passes'
     figures silently did.
  4. ⚠️ **When you DELETE a mechanism, grep its vocabulary and read every hit asking
     whether it is cited as the JUSTIFICATION for unrelated behaviour.** A sweep aimed at
     *usage* misses these — the code no longer used the ring, but comments still cited it
     as the reason for something else, leaving a true conclusion propped up by a false
     premise. The class shares one shape: **the conclusion survived the change and its
     justification did not.**

     ⚠️ **The term list is an artifact, not a memory: `docs/agents/deleted-vocabulary.md`.**
     Add a mechanism's vocabulary there when you delete it. `scripts/sweep-vocabulary.py`
     is a gate step and scans the lines your change **adds**, printing each hit with its
     recorded disposition — so the legitimate ones are not re-adjudicated every time.
     ⚠️ It **prints and passes**: most hits are correct prose, and a check that fires on
     correct code teaches people to ignore it. Read them; a reviewer decides.

     ⚠️ **It keeps no counts, and that is the design.** A recorded population cannot tell
     "removed two legitimate uses, added one stale claim" from "removed one", so a
     prose-purging change that also adds a stale claim nets down and reads clean. A count
     also needs globs, and a glob list goes stale in silence — the version that kept counts
     covered 40 files and never saw `test/`, `src/backend/rails/` or `scripts/`.

     ⚠️ **Derive the term list from the deletion itself, not from the names you remember
     — and include the VERB for what the mechanism did.** The first attempt at this swept
     `ring`, `capacity`, `float`, `treasury`, `burn cap` and missed **`evict`/`eviction`**,
     which is a verb the code no longer uses — leaving five survivors including an
     operator-facing RUNBOOK line stating a cap that no longer exists as a parameter, and
     a second false `AddResult.evicted` reference 118 lines from the one that had just
     been fixed. Also sweep the **names of deleted variants**: `#deliveryDelayed` and
     `#abandoned` were still live rows in RUNBOOK §6's triage table, and the surviving
     rows still carried the *old* field lists.
  5. ⚠️ **Verify the `DESIGN.md` section against the CODE before the deletion, not
     after.** A section transcribed from comments inherits the comments' errors, and once
     the comments are gone the original is no longer there to audit against. Three of
     three passes so far found a comment whose *conclusion* was right and whose *stated
     reason* was false — so "it was in the comment" is not evidence.
- ⚠️ **`⚠️` is tiered: prohibitions only.** Use it where ignoring the line loses money or
  breaks an invariant — not for explanation. A marker used 310 times is not a marker;
  it only works while seeing one makes you stop.
- ⚠️ **`docs/DESIGN.md` is where a DECISION goes, and it is enforced.** Code comments say
  what the code *does*; the reason it is that way goes in the `§N` record.
  `scripts/check-design-sections.py` fails the gate if a `§N` the code cites has no
  section, or a section is cited by nothing — so it cannot silently drift out of use.
  ⚠️ **What no check can verify is whether a section is TRUE**, which is why the rule is
  *change the behaviour, change that file in the same commit*. Its predecessor did not
  rot by being abandoned; it rotted by being updated less often than the code.
- The committed `src/backend/dist/backend.did` is the embedded `candid:service`
  metadata *and* the frontend's bindgen source. Run `mops build` after any
  backend API change, and commit the regenerated `.did`.
- **Where to look for what:**

  | Question | Source |
  |---|---|
  | What does it do? | the code, and `docs/STRIPE.md` for the Card rail end to end |
  | How do I operate it? | `RUNBOOK.md` — authoritative for procedure |
  | Why is it built this way? | `docs/DESIGN.md` — the `§N` record, gate-enforced |

  ⚠️ The spec is **non-binding rationale, not a contract.** Several of its
  decisions have been superseded; those sections say so inline and keep the
  original reasoning for provenance. **The implementation wins where they
  disagree** — never "fix" code to match the spec without checking whether the
  spec is the stale side.

- **Any fact about money lives on a permanent record.** The audit log is a
  4,096-entry ring buffer and drops its oldest entries, so it is telemetry only.
  If a new behaviour produces a fact someone could need in six months — what was
  paid, what was delivered, which block carried it — put it on the order or the
  journal, not only in an audit tag.

## Issue tracker

Issues for this repo live in GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

**GitHub Issues is the single source of truth for all task and progress
tracking.** `PRD.md` was deleted 2026-09-09: it was frozen in June and described the
ICP-float / CMC-mint / ck-USDC architecture, none of which exists, so a reader
found a confident account of a system that no longer exists. Recoverable from git history
if ever needed.

⚠️ **Rewriting a long issue BODY goes through `scripts/issue-body.py`, not through a
shell heredoc.** A long issue body was destroyed this way — Markdown built in an *unquoted* heredoc let
the shell run the backticks in the text, and a mangled 101k-char body replaced 53k. The
script does the three things that make the edit recoverable and checkable:

```bash
scripts/issue-body.py get  12 /tmp/i12.md   # fetch, verified against the API's own count
#   ...edit /tmp/i12.md...
scripts/issue-body.py put  12 /tmp/i12.md   # write, then RE-FETCH to prove it stored
scripts/issue-body.py diff 12 /tmp/i12.md   # is the remote still what this file says?
```

⚠️ **`put` verifies by reading back**, because GitHub accepting the request is not
evidence: the corrupting write was accepted cleanly. Adding a *comment* needs none of
this — `gh-axi issue comment N --body-file <path>` is additive and cannot destroy a body,
so prefer a comment whenever the content is additive.

## Triage labels

Default vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`,
`ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

## Verifying your work

Never report a task done on a build alone. **One command runs the whole gate:**

```sh
scripts/test-all.sh          # everything, in dependency order, fail-fast
scripts/test-all.sh --fast   # skips the PocketIC suite (see the host note below)
```

⚠️ **Several of its steps are checks a hand-run sequence silently skips**, and each exists
because the thing it checks had already drifted once. No count here: the script derives its
own total by counting its `run` invocations, and a number restated in prose is one more
thing to expire.

| step | asserts | why |
|---|---|---|
| `.did` is current | the committed interface matches the code | it is both the embedded `candid:service` metadata and the frontend's bindgen source |
| `check-doc-surface.py` | the docs' method lists match the `.did` | `docs/STRIPE.md` claimed "the whole admin surface" while missing 11 of 29, and RUNBOOK named a method that never existed |
| `check-design-sections.py` | every `§N` the code cites exists in `docs/DESIGN.md`, and every section is cited | the 697-line spec it replaced rotted by being updated less often than the code |
| `check-heredocs.sh` | no unquoted heredoc runs its own body | one destroyed a GitHub issue body, one turned a script's notes into an `icp deploy` |
| `mops check`'s stable check | the actor's stable shape is still compatible with `deployed/backend.most` | an incompatible shape passed every step and was refused at DEPLOY time instead; ⚠️ it also fails when the baseline is missing, which is what stops it self-certifying |
| `scripts/check-stable-promotion.sh` | ⚠️ not in the gate — it runs at PROMOTION time, which the gate cannot see. Whether a baseline diff is type-hash renumbering or a real shape change | a promotion blessed a real change because the diff looked like compiler noise. 91 of ~260 lines move on a compiler bump alone |
| `check-bindings.sh` | the suite's committed Candid bindings match the `.did` | the integration CI job installs only that suite's deps and never builds the backend, so it typechecks against whatever is in the checkout |
| `check-unused-exports.py` | no module exports something nothing calls | a deleted caller leaves an export that reads as live API |
| `sweep-vocabulary.py` | prints added lines naming a deleted mechanism | ⚠️ **advisory — it passes on hits**; it fails only when it cannot determine a base ref, which is the didn't-run case |

### The stable baseline, and the two compatibility checks that are NOT the same thing

⚠️ **The gate reports two different kinds of incompatibility, and reading one as the other
has cost a sibling project two wrong deploy instructions** — one of which, followed, would
have destroyed a canister's whole event log. Keep them apart:

⚠️ Named by the command that reports them, not by step number — a step number in prose
goes stale the next time a step is inserted, and the script derives its own numbering.

| what you see | it means | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `mops build`: `.did is out of date` | the **committed Candid file** does not match the code | `mops build`, commit the `.did`, regenerate the suite's bindings. ⚠️ Says NOTHING about stable state — an added method trips this and is perfectly upgradable |
| `mops check`: `Stable compatibility check failed` | the **stable shape** cannot be reinterpreted from the deployed one | locally reinstall and reseed; on mainnet this needs a migration. ⚠️ This is the one where deployed data is at stake |

**After ANY change that moves the stable shape — compatible or not** — once it is deployed
(reinstalled and reseeded if it had to be):

⚠️ **"Compatible" does not mean "no promotion", and the failure is a genuinely
incompatible change PASSING.** Measured, in two steps:

1. Add `probeF : Nat` with an initializer. Upgrade-compatible, no reinstall needed —
   `mops check-stable` passes, correctly. Skip the promotion.
2. Change `probeF` to `Text`. Against the **stale** baseline, which has no `probeF` at all,
   that reads as "adding `probeF : Text`" and `mops check-stable` **passes again**. The
   deployed canister holds `probeF : Nat`, so the real upgrade is incompatible and traps in
   `post_upgrade`.

So the baseline moves whenever the shape moves. One un-promoted compatible change is
enough to blind the check to the next incompatible one.

```sh
mops build
scripts/check-stable-promotion.sh  # what IS this diff? see below — run it BEFORE promoting
mops deployed                      # promotes dist/backend.most → deployed/backend.most
git add deployed/backend.most      # committed in the SAME PR as the shape change
```

⚠️ **Read the diff with the script, never with your eyes.** A compiler upgrade renumbers
every type hash in the file: moc 1.9.0 → 1.15.1 moved **91 of ~260 lines** without
changing a single field. A real schema change lands in the same file, in the same shape of
diff, and is invisible inside that noise — which is the mirror image of the stale-baseline
hole above, and just as green.

`scripts/check-stable-promotion.sh` decides it instead, by running
`moc --stable-compatible` **both ways**. Mutual compatibility means the two signatures are
mutual subtypes, i.e. equivalent, so the diff is pure renumbering. Its three verdicts, each
probed against a deliberate mutation rather than assumed:

| Verdict | Means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `REPRESENTATION-ONLY` | both directions pass — equivalent signatures | promote without review; note the compiler bump in the commit |
| `REAL shape change (upgrade-compatible)` | forward only — a field was added or widened | promote deliberately, and **name what moved** in the commit |
| `NOT upgrade-compatible` | forward fails — a deployed canister cannot take it | not a promotion. Reinstall pre-launch, or write the migration |

⚠️ **This is correct ONLY while the shape change is accompanied by a reinstall — and
nothing in the toolchain will tell you when that stops being true.** Pre-launch,
re-promoting is the right answer to a failed check every single time, which is exactly how
it becomes a reflex. Once the canister holds data that cannot be recreated, the command
still succeeds, the check goes green, and the incompatibility is blessed against real data.
**The remedy for the failure is the command that erases the evidence of it.**

After that point a failed check means *write a migration* (`docs/OPERATE.md`, Mode 3). ⚠️ **The trigger is a
state, not a date:** the first mainnet deploy you intend to keep, or the first real buyer's
order. Until then reinstall is free and the chain buys nothing; after then `mops deployed`
is silently the wrong answer.

⚠️ **The baseline must be committed, and it must not be the build's own output.**
`src/backend/dist/backend.most` is gitignored with the rest of `dist/`, so configuring the
check against it compares an artifact to a fresh regeneration of itself — measured before
this was wired: it PASSED on the very change the real baseline rejects. `mops check` fails
when `deployed/backend.most` is absent (`Deployed file not found`), which is what stops a
missing or uncommitted baseline from reading as a clean check.

⚠️ **Do not annotate the `.most`.** It is parsed, and the check is an equality comparison
against a build artifact — commit it verbatim. The commit message is where the reason goes.

**A committed baseline does double duty:** the check answers *is this safe*, and the diff
answers *did the stable shape change at all* — the second is the question a reviewer can
act on without re-deriving the first.

The individual steps, if you need to run one in isolation:

```sh
mops check                                   # lint + typecheck
mops test                                    # Motoko unit suites
mops build                                   # refreshes the committed .did
scripts/check-doc-surface.py                 # docs' method lists vs the .did
scripts/check-design-sections.py             # §N citations vs docs/DESIGN.md
npm --prefix src/frontend run build          # regenerates bindings
npm --prefix src/frontend run typecheck
npm --prefix src/frontend run test           # pure functions + jsdom (main.ts)
bash scripts/brand-lint.sh                   # banned characters, vocabulary, tokens
npm --prefix test/browser test               # Chromium: cascade, layout, paint
npm --prefix test/integration run typecheck   # vitest does not typecheck
scripts/sweep-vocabulary.py                  # added lines vs the deleted-mechanism list
mops deployed                                # promote the stable baseline after a shape change
npm --prefix test/integration test           # PocketIC scenarios — the go-live bar
```

⚠️ **No frontend change is done on a jsdom pass alone.** jsdom has no cascade and
no layout, so `el.hidden` reads true for an element a class selector is keeping on
screen — that has shipped twice. The browser suite is not optional and the gate
now fails outright if it cannot run. Surfaces that need a session or a delivered
order are reachable through the test-only fixture hook
(`src/frontend/src/fixtures.ts`); see `test/browser/delivered.spec.ts`.

⚠️ **`npm test`, never `npx vitest run`** for the integration suite: the latter
skips `pretest`, which fetches the sha256-pinned wasms and rebuilds the backend —
so it silently tests a stale wasm and passes.

The PocketIC suite needs a **4 KiB-page host** (macOS or x86_64 Linux). It
cannot run in arm64 Linux guests with 16 KiB pages — the replica hard-asserts
4096-byte pages and the server dies at instance creation. If you cannot run it,
say the bar is unverified; do not infer it from the unit tests.
